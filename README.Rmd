## Overview

**bibliometrix** provides a comprehensive set of tools for quantitative
research in bibliometrics and scientometrics.

Bibliometrics applies quantitative analysis and statistics to scientific
publications and their citation patterns. It has become essential across
all scientific fields for evaluating growth, maturity, leading authors,
conceptual and intellectual maps, and emerging trends within research
communities.

Today, bibliometrics is widely used in research performance evaluation
by universities, government laboratories, policymakers, research
directors, information specialists, librarians, and scholars themselves.

**bibliometrix** supports scholars in three key phases of analysis:

-   **Data importing and conversion** to R format from major
    bibliographic databases;

-   **Bibliometric analysis** of publication datasets, including
    descriptive statistics, author productivity, and source impact;

-   **Building and visualizing matrices** for co-citation, coupling,
    collaboration, and co-word analysis. These matrices serve as input
    for network analysis, multiple correspondence analysis, and other
    data reduction techniques.

## biblioshiny

**bibliometrix** includes **biblioshiny: bibliometrix for no-coders**

Data importing and converting:
<https://www.bibliometrix.org/vignettes/Data-Importing-and-Converting.html>

## Installation

Install the stable version from CRAN:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bibliometrix")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("pak", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("massimoaria/bibliometrix")
```

Load `bibliometrix`:

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(bibliometrix)
```

## Data loading and converting

Export files from bibliographic databases can be imported into R using
the function **convert2df**:

**convert2df**(*file*, *dbsource*, *format*)

The argument *file* is a character vector containing the names of export
files downloaded from SCOPUS, Clarivate Analytics WoS, OpenAlex, Digital
Science Dimensions, PubMed, Lens.org, or Cochrane CDSR. The *file*
argument can also contain JSON/XML objects downloaded using OpenAlex,
Digital Science Dimensions, or PubMed APIs (through the packages
*openalexR*, *dimensionsR*, and *pubmedR*).

Example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
file <- c("file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...)
```

```{r Data loading and Converting}
## An example from bibliometrix vignettes

file <- c("https://www.bibliometrix.org/datasets/management1.txt","https://www.bibliometrix.org/datasets/management2.txt")

M <- convert2df(file = file, dbsource = "wos", format = "plaintext")

data(management, package = "bibliometrixData")
M <- management
```

The **convert2df** function creates a bibliographic data frame where
rows correspond to manuscripts and columns to metadata fields.

Each manuscript contains multiple elements including authors' names,
title, keywords, abstract, and other bibliographic information. All
these elements constitute the metadata of a document.

Data frame columns are named using the standard Clarivate Analytics WoS
Field Tag codes: [(Field Tags
documentation)](https://www.bibliometrix.org/documents/Field_Tags_bibliometrix.pdf)

## Checking metadata completeness

After importing a bibliographic data frame, you can assess the
completeness of metadata using **missingData()**:

**missingData**(*M*)

The argument *M* is a bibliographic data frame obtained by the
**convert2df** function.

```{r Completeness of metadata}
## An example from bibliometrix vignettes

com <- missingData(M)

com$mandatoryTags
```

## Bibliometric Analysis

The function **biblioAnalysis** performs a comprehensive bibliometric
analysis of a dataset, calculating main bibliometric measures.

**biblioAnalysis**(*M*, *sep = ";"*)

The argument *sep* indicates the field separator character used in the
data frame.

```{r biblioAnalysis}
results <- biblioAnalysis(M, sep = ";")
```

The **biblioAnalysis** function returns an object of class
"bibliometrix" containing:

-   Annual scientific production
-   Most productive authors
-   Most cited manuscripts
-   Most productive countries
-   Total citations per country\
-   Most relevant sources (journals)
-   Most frequent keywords

Use the generic function **summary** to display main results:

```{r summary generic function}
S <- summary(object = results, k = 10, pause = FALSE)
```

The *k* parameter specifies the number of rows to display in each table
(top k authors, sources, etc.). The *pause* parameter controls whether
to pause between tables.

Basic visualizations can be generated using the **plot** function:

```{r plot generic function, fig.width=7}
plot(x = results, k = 10, pause = FALSE)
```

## Author Bio Cards

The **AuthorBio** function retrieves and displays biographical
information about authors using OpenAlex data:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Example: Get biographical information for an author
authorInfo <- authorBio(author_position = 1, 
                        doi = "10.1016/j.joi.2017.08.007")

dplyr::glimpse(authorInfo)
```

This function provides comprehensive author profiles including:

-   Institutional affiliations
-   Research areas and topics
-   Publication history
-   Citation metrics
-   Co-author networks

## Citation Matching

The **applyCitationMatching** function implements an intelligent
algorithm to match and reconcile citations across different databases:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Apply citation matching to improve reference consistency
results <- applyCitationMatching(management, threshold = 0.85)
```

This feature is particularly useful when:

-   Merging datasets from multiple databases
-   Identifying duplicate or variant citations
-   Building accurate citation networks
-   Conducting historiographic analysis

## Life Cycle Analysis

The **lifeCycle** function analyzes the temporal evolution of research
topics, identifying different phases in their development:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Perform life cycle analysis
data <- M %>% group_by(PY) %>% count()
LC <- lifeCycle(data, forecast_years = 20, plot = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)

print(LC$parameters)

print(LC$metrics)
```

The \*\*Life Cycle of Scientific Production\* function implements a
logistic growth model to analyze the temporal dynamics of research
topics. This approach, grounded in the theory of scientific paradigms
and innovation diffusion, allows researchers to identify the current
developmental stage of a field, predict future trends, and estimate when
a topic will reach maturity or saturation.

By fitting a logistic curve to the annual publication counts in your
collection, this analysis reveals whether a research area is in its
emergence phase, rapid growth phase, maturity phase, or decline phase.

## Bibliographic network matrices

Manuscript attributes are interconnected through the publications
themselves: authors link to journals, keywords to publication dates, and
references create citation networks.

These connections form bipartite networks that can be represented as
rectangular matrices (Manuscripts × Attributes).

Additionally, scientific publications regularly cite other works,
generating co-citation and coupling networks that reveal the
intellectual structure of research fields.

### biblioNetwork function

The **biblioNetwork** function calculates the most frequently used
bibliometric networks from a bibliographic data frame:

**Analysis types:** - **Coupling**: Documents sharing references -
**Co-citation**: References cited together - **Co-occurrences**:
Keywords or terms appearing together\
- **Collaboration**: Co-authorship patterns

**Network levels:** - Authors - References - Sources (journals) -
Countries - Universities - Keywords (Author keywords or Keywords Plus) -
Titles - Abstracts

Example - classical co-citation network:

```{r eval=FALSE}
NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, analysis = "co-citation", network = "references", sep = ";")
```

## Visualizing bibliographic networks

Bibliographic networks can be visualized and analyzed using the
**networkPlot** function, which offers multiple layout algorithms and
customization options.

The main argument *type* specifies the network layout: circle,
kamada-kawai, fruchterman-reingold, mds, etc.

### Country Scientific Collaboration

```{r Country collaboration, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
# Create a country collaboration network

M <- metaTagExtraction(M, Field = "AU_CO", sep = ";")
NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, analysis = "collaboration", network = "countries", sep = ";")

# Plot the network
net <- networkPlot(NetMatrix, n = dim(NetMatrix)[1], Title = "Country Collaboration", 
                   type = "circle", size = TRUE, remove.multiple = FALSE, labelsize = 0.8)
```

This visualization reveals international research collaborations,
highlighting countries with strong scientific partnerships.

### Co-Citation Network

```{r Co-citation network, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
# Create a co-citation network

NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, analysis = "co-citation", network = "references", n = 30, sep = ";")

# Plot the network
net <- networkPlot(NetMatrix, Title = "Co-Citation Network", type = "fruchterman", 
                   size = TRUE, remove.multiple = FALSE, labelsize = 0.7, edgesize = 5)
```

Co-citation analysis identifies the intellectual foundations of a
research field by revealing which references are frequently cited
together.

### Keyword Co-occurrences

```{r Keyword co-occurrences, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
# Create keyword co-occurrences network

NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, analysis = "co-occurrences", network = "keywords", sep = ";")

# Plot the network
net <- networkPlot(NetMatrix, normalize = "association", weighted = TRUE, n = 30, 
                   Title = "Keyword Co-occurrences", type = "fruchterman", 
                   size = TRUE, edgesize = 5, labelsize = 0.7)
```

Keyword co-occurrence networks reveal the conceptual structure of a
research field, identifying main themes and their relationships.

### Thematic Map

The thematicMap function creates a **strategic diagram** based on
co-word network analysis and clustering. It plots themes in a
two-dimensional space according to their centrality (measure of
importance) and density (measure of development).

This visualization helps identify:

\- Motor Themes (well-developed and central),

\- Niche Themes (well-developed but peripheral),

\- Emerging or Declining Themes (weakly developed), and

\- Basic Themes (important but not well-developed).

The methodology is based on Cobo et al. (2011) co-word analysis
approach.

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
# Create a Thematic Map
thematicMapResults <- thematicMap(M, field = "DE", n = 250, minfreq = 5, 
                                  stemming = FALSE, size = 0.3, n.labels = 3, 
                                  repel = TRUE, cluster="louvain")
plot(thematicMapResults$map)
plot(thematicMapResults$net$graph)
```

### Thematic Evolution

The thematicEvolution function analyzes how themes evolve over time by
dividing the collection into multiple time periods and tracking thematic
changes across them.
It performs a thematic map analysis for each period and measures the
conceptual relationships between themes in consecutive periods using
inclusion indexes and stability measures. This longitudinal analysis
reveals emerging topics, declining themes, stable research areas, and
thematic transformations.

The function produces an interactive Sankey-like diagram showing
thematic flows between periods, along with strategic maps for each time
slice.

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=9}
# Thematic Evolution
TEResults <- thematicEvolution(M, field = "DE", n = 250, 
                                              minFreq = 5, stemming = FALSE, 
                                              size = 0.3, n.labels = 1, 
                                              repel = TRUE, cluster="louvain", 
                                              years = c(2004, 2008, 2015))
plotThematicEvolution(TEResults$Nodes, TEResults$Edges, measure="weighted")

```

#### 1985-2004

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=9}
# 1985-2004
plot(TEResults$TM[[1]]$map)

```

#### 2005-2008

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=9}

# 2005-2008
plot(TEResults$TM[[2]]$map)

```

#### 2009-2015

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=9}


# 2009-2015
plot(TEResults$TM[[3]]$map)

```

#### 2016-2020

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=9}

# 2016-2020
plot(TEResults$TM[[4]]$map)
```

## Co-Word Analysis: The conceptual structure of a field

Co-word analysis maps the conceptual structure of a research domain by
examining word co-occurrences in a bibliographic collection.

The analysis employs dimensionality reduction techniques including: -
**Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)** - **Correspondence Analysis
(CA)** - **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**

The **conceptualStructure** function performs CA or MCA to visualize the
conceptual structure and uses K-means clustering to identify document
clusters sharing common themes. Results are displayed on two-dimensional
maps.

The function includes natural language processing (NLP) routines (see
**termExtraction**) to extract terms from titles and abstracts, and
implements Porter's stemming algorithm to reduce words to their root
form.

```{r Co-Word Analysis, fig.height=9, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
# Conceptual Structure using keywords (method="MCA")

CS <- conceptualStructure(M, field = "ID", method = "MCA", minDegree = 10, 
                          clust = 5, stemming = FALSE, labelsize = 15, 
                          documents = 20, graph = FALSE)

plot(CS$graph_terms)
plot(CS$graph_dendogram)
```

This analysis helps identify: - Main research themes and sub-themes -
Relationships between concepts - Evolution of research focus - Emerging
topics and declining areas

## Referenced Publication Years Spectroscopy (RPYS)

RPYS analysis examines the age distribution of cited references to
identify seminal works and breakthrough moments in a research field. The
**rpys** function provides advanced capabilities for detecting:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Perform RPYS analysis
rpysResults <- rpys(M, sep = ";", timespan = NULL, graph = TRUE)

print(rpysResults$Sequences %>% filter(Class!="") %>% group_by(Class) %>% slice_max(order_by=Freq,n=3, with_ties = FALSE) %>% arrange(desc(RPY),.by_group = TRUE), n=30)
```

The analysis identifies four types of influential references:

-   **Hot Papers**: Recently published works receiving immediate,
    intense attention
-   **Constant Performers**: Works consistently cited over extended
    periods
-   **Life Cycles**: Publications showing typical rise and fall patterns
    in citation frequency
-   **Sleeping Beauties**: Works initially overlooked but later
    recognized as significant contributions

RPYS helps researchers: - Identify foundational works in a field -
Detect breakthrough moments and paradigm shifts - Understand citation
patterns over time - Discover underappreciated but important
contributions

## Historical Direct Citation Network

The historiograph, proposed by Eugene Garfield, represents a
chronological network of the most relevant direct citations in a
bibliographic collection.

The **histNetwork** function generates a chronological direct citation
network matrix that can be visualized using **histPlot**:

```{r Historical Co-citation network, fig.height=9, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
# Create a historical citation network

histResults <- histNetwork(M, sep = ";")

# Plot a historical citation network
net <- histPlot(histResults, n = 20, size = FALSE, label = "short")
```

The historiograph reveals: - The chronological development of ideas in a
field - Key publications and their influence over time - Citation paths
showing knowledge flow - Temporal relationships between foundational
works

This visualization is particularly valuable for understanding how
scientific knowledge evolves and builds upon previous research.
