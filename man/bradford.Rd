\usage{
bradford(M)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{is a bibliographic dataframe.}
}
\value{
The function \code{bradford} returns a list containing the following objects:
\tabular{lll}{
\code{table}  \tab   \tab a dataframe with the source distribution partitioned in the three zones\cr
\code{graph}   \tab   \tab the source distribution plot in ggplot2 format}
}
\description{
It estimates and draws the Bradford's law source distribution.
}
\details{
Bradford's law is a pattern first described by (\cite{Samuel C. Bradford, 1934}) that estimates the exponentially diminishing returns 
of searching for references in science journals. 

One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, 
then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n2.\cr\cr
