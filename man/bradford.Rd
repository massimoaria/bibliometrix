\code{table}       \tab   \tab a dataframe with the source distribution partitioned in the three zones\cr
\code{graph}       \tab   \tab the Bradford bibliograph plot in ggplot2 format\cr
\code{graph_shiny} \tab   \tab the Bradford bibliograph plot for biblioshiny (without logo)\cr
\code{zoneSummary} \tab   \tab a dataframe summarizing the three Bradford zones\cr
\code{stat}        \tab   \tab a list of statistical results (coefficients, R2, KS test, Bradford multiplier)}

\description{
It estimates Bradford's law source distribution and tests the goodness of fit.

\details{
Bradford's Law of Scattering, first formulated by Samuel C. Bradford in 1934,
describes the phenomenon of concentration and dispersion in scientific publishing:
a small number of core journals account for a disproportionately large share of the
literature on a given topic, while the remaining literature is scattered across an
increasingly large number of peripheral journals.\cr\cr

If journals are ranked in decreasing order of productivity and partitioned into three
zones, each containing roughly one-third of the total articles, the number of journals
in each zone follows the ratio 1:n:n^2, where n is the Bradford multiplier.\cr\cr

The Bradford distribution models the cumulative number of articles C(r) contributed
by the top r sources as: C(r) = a + b * log(r)\cr\cr
