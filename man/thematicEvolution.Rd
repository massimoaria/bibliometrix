\title{Perform a Thematic Evolution Analysis}
\usage{
thematicEvolution(
  M,
  field = "ID",
  years,
  n = 250,
  minFreq = 2,
  size = 0.5,
  ngrams = 1,
  stemming = FALSE,
  n.labels = 1,
  repel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{is a bibliographic data frame obtained by the converting function \code{\link{convert2df}}.}

\item{field}{is a character object. It indicates the content field to use. Field can be one of c=("ID","DE","TI","AB"). Default value is \code{field="ID"}.}

\item{years}{is a numeric vector of two or more unique cut points.}

\item{n}{is numerical. It indicates the number of words to use in the network analysis}

\item{minFreq}{is numerical. It indicates the min frequency of words included in to a cluster.}

\item{size}{is numerical. It indicates del size of the cluster circles and is a number in the range (0.01,1).}

\item{ngrams}{is an integer between 1 and 4. It indicates the type of n-gram to extract from texts. 
An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n terms. The function can extract n-grams composed by 1, 2, 3 or 4 terms. Default value is \code{ngrams=1}.}

\item{stemming}{is logical. If it is TRUE the word (from titles or abstracts) will be stemmed (using the Porter's algorithm).}

\item{n.labels}{is integer. It indicates how many labels associate to each cluster. Default is \code{n.labels = 1}.}

\item{repel}{is logical. If it is TRUE ggplot uses geom_label_repel instead of geom_label.}

}
\description{
It performs a Thematic Evolution Analysis based on co-word network analysis and clustering.
The methodology is inspired by the proposal of Cobo et al. (2011).

\code{\link{thematicEvolution}} starts from two or more thematic maps created by \code{\link{thematicMap}} function.\cr\cr
