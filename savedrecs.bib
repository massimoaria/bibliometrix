Title = {{The framework for approximate queries on simulation data}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{3-20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{AQSim is a system intended to enable scientists to query and analyze a
   large volume of scientific simulation data. The system uses the state of
   the art in approximate query processing techniques to build a novel
   framework for progressive data analysis. These techniques are used to
   define a multi-resolution index, where each node contains multiple
   models of the data. The benefits of these models are twofold: (1) they
   have compact representations, reconstructing only the information
   relevant to the analysis, and (2) the variety of models capture
   different aspects of the data which may be of interest to the user but
   are not readily apparent in their raw form. To be able to deal with the
   data interactively, AQSim allows the scientist to make an informed
   tradeoff between query response accuracy and time. In this paper, we
   present the framework of AQSim with a focus on its architectural design.
   We also show the results from an initial proof-of-concept prototype
   developed at LLNL. The presented framework is generic enough to handle
   more than just simulation data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{(Almost) Optimal parallel block access for range queries}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{21-31}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Range queries are an important class of queries for several applications
   can be achieved by tiling the multi-dimensional data and distributing it
   among multiple disks or nodes. It has been established that schemes that
   achieve optimal parallel block access exist only for a few special
   cases. Though several schemes for the allocation of tiles to disks have
   been developed, no scheme with non-trivial worst-case bound is known. We
   establish that any range query on a 2(q) x 2(q)-block grid of blocks can
   be performed using k = 2(t) disks (t less than or equal to q), in at
   most {[}m/k] + O(log k) parallel block accesses. We achieve this result
   by judiciously distributing the blocks among the k nodes or disks.
   Experimental data show that the algorithm achieves very close to {[}m/k]
   performance (on average less than 0.5 away from {[}m/k], with a
   worst-case of 3). Although several declustering schemes for range
   queries have been developed, prior to our work no additive non-trivial
   performance bounds were known. Our scheme guarantees performance within
   a (small) additive deviation from {[}m/k]. Subsequent to this work,
   Bhatia et al. {[}Hierarchical declustering schemes for range queries,
   in: Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database
   Technology, Konstanz, Germany, March 2000, p. 525] have proved that such
   a performance bound is essentially optimal for this kind of scheme, and
   have also extended our results to the case where the number of disks is
   a product of the form k(1 {*}) k(2) (...)({*})({*}) k(t) where the k(i)s
   need not all be 2. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Pages = {{33-71}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Skewness has been one of the major problems not only in parallel
   relational database systems, but also in parallel object-oriented
   database systems. To improve performance of object-oriented query
   processing, a careful and intelligent skew handling for load balancing
   must be established. Depending on the parallel machine environment,
   whether it is a shared-memory or a shared-nothing architecture, load
   balancing can be achieved through ``physical{''} or ``logical{''} data
   re-distribution. It is not the aim of this paper to propose or to
   investigate skew handling methods, but rather to analyze the impact of
   load balancing to query execution scheduling strategies. Our analysis
   shows that when load balancing is achieved, ``serial{''} execution
   scheduling is preferable to ``parallel{''} execution scheduling
   strategy. In other words, allocating full resources to a sub-query seems
   to be better than dividing resources to multiple sub-queries. (C) 2003

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},

Pages = {{73-110}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Optical multistage interconnection networks (OMINs), based on 2x2
   directional coupler photonic switches, play a significant role in
   all-optical lightwave networks. Space dilation reduces the native effect
   of switch crossover. This paper presents two types of dilated
   re-arrangeable networks extended from dilated blocking networks: a class
   of two cascaded dilated blocking networks, such as dilated\_blocking
   network-dilated\_blocking\_network architectures, and the other type can
   be extended from the dilated blocking networks, i.e. horizontal
   cascading (HC) or vertical stacking (VS). Optical crosstalk, an
   underestimated problem in OMINs, is the effect of undesirable coupling
   of signals between paths within a directional coupler due to its rapid
   aging. A switch is faulty if it causes excessive crosstalk in excess of
   a given threshold. Diagnosing faulty switch is essential issue in OMINs.
   Previous work {[}Inform. Sci.: Int. J. 124 (2000) 59] has developed the
   appropriate diagnostic algorithm for dilated blocking photonic networks.
   This paper devises diagnostic algorithms for dilated re-arrangeable
   networks, which benefits from {[}Inform. Sci.: Int. J. 124 (2000) 59].
   The proposed algorithm is also verified in this paper. (C) 2003 Elsevier

   high-speed real-time applications is introduced. The proposed learning
   automata have a unique characteristic: they are capable of performing
   both probability updating and action selection with a computational
   complexity which is independent of the number of actions. Apart from
   their low computational complexity, the proposed automata are capable of
   achieving a high performance when operating in non-stationary stochastic
   environments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fuzzy group decision-making for facility location selection}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{157}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The selection of a facility location among alternative locations is a
   multicriteria decision-making problem including both quantitative and
   qualitative criteria. The conventional approaches to facility location
   problem tend to be less effective in dealing with the imprecise or
   vagueness nature of the linguistic assessment. Under many situations,
   the values of the qualitative criteria are often imprecisely defined for
   the decision-makers. The aim of the paper is to solve facility location
   problems using different solution approaches of fuzzy multi-attribute
   group decision-making. The paper includes four different fuzzy
   multi-attribute group decision-making approaches. The first one is a
   fuzzy model of group decision proposed by Blin. The second is the fuzzy
   synthetic evaluation. The third is Yager's weighted goals method and the
   last one is fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. Although four approaches
   have the same objective of selecting the best facility location
   alternative, they come from different theoretic backgrounds and relate
   differently to the discipline of multi-attribute group decision-making.
   These approaches are extended to select the best facility location
   alternative by taking into account quantitative and qualitative
   criteria. A short comparative analysis among the approaches and a
   numeric example to each approach are given. (C) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {{Let G(V, E, W) denote a graph with vertex-set V and edge-set E, and each
   vertex v is associated with a cost W(v). For any set V' subset of or
   equal to V, the bottleneck cost of V' is defined as
   max\{W(x)\textbackslash{}x is an element of V'\}.
   This paper considers the bottleneck independent dominating set problem
   (the BIDS problem) which determines an independent dominating set of G
   such that its bottleneck cost is minimized. This paper studies the
   problem on the classes of bipartite graphs and block graphs. This paper
   first proves that the problem is NP-hard on chordal-bipartite graphs.
   Second, a linear-time algorithm on convex-bipartite graphs is proposed.
   Next, a linear-time algorithm on trees is designed. Then, we generalize
   the algorithmic result to block graphs. All algorithms are designed by
   the dynamic programming strategy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Conventional approaches to text analysis and information retrieval which
   measured document similarity by using considering all of the information
   in texts are a relatively inefficiency for processing large text
   collections in heterogeneous subject areas. This paper outlined a new
   text manipulation system FA-Sim that is useful for retrieving
   information in large heterogeneous texts and for recognizing content
   similarity in text excerpts. FA-Sim is based on flexible text matching
   procedures carried out in various contexts and various field ranks.
   FA-Sim measures texts similarity by using specific field association
   (FA) terms instead of by comparing all text information. Similarity
   between texts is faster and higher by using FA-Sim than other two
   analysis methods. Therefore, Recall and Precision significantly improved
   by 39\% and 37\% over these two traditional methods. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Researchers in indexing and retrieval systems have been advocating the
   inclusion of more contextual information to improve results. The
   proliferation of full-text databases and advances in computer storage
   capacity have made it possible to carry out text analysis by means of
   linguistic and extra-linguistic knowledge. Since the mid 80s, research
   has tended to pay more attention to context, giving discourse analysis a
   more central role. The research presented in this paper aims to check
   whether discourse variables have an impact on modern information
   retrieval and classification algorithms. In order to evaluate this
   hypothesis, a functional framework for information analysis in an
   automated environment has been proposed, where the n-grams (filtering)
   and the k-means and Chen's classification algorithms have been tested
   against sub-collections of documents based on the following discourse
   variables: ``Genre{''}, ``Register{''}, ``Domain terminology{''}, and
   ``Document structure{''}. The results obtained with the algorithms for
   the different sub-collections were compared to the MeSH information
   structure. These demonstrate that n-grams does not appear to have a
   clear dependence on discourse variables, though the k-means
   classification algorithm does, but only on domain terminology and
   document structure, and finally Chen's algorithm has a clear dependence
   on all of the discourse variables. This information could be used to
   design better classification algorithms, where discourse variables
   should be taken into account. Other minor conclusions drawn from these
   results are also presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Past research into text retrieval methods for the Web has been
   restricted by the lack of a test collection capable of supporting
   experiments which are both realistic and reproducible. The 1.69 million
   document WT10g collection is proposed as a multi-purpose testbed for
   experiments with these attributes, in distributed IR, hyperlink
   algorithms and conventional ad hoe retrieval.
   WT10g was constructed by selecting from a superset of documents in such
   a way that desirable corpus properties were preserved or optimised.
   These properties include: a high degree of inter-server connectivity,
   integrity of server holdings, inclusion of documents related to a very
   wide spread of likely queries, and a realistic distribution of server
   holding sizes. We confirm that WT10g contains exploitable link
   information using a site (homepage) finding experiment. Our results show
   that, on this task, Okapi BM25 works better on propagated link anchor
   text than on full text.
   WT10g was used in TREC-9 and TREC-2000 and both topic relevance and
   homepage finding queries and Judgments are available. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As Web-related techniques and equipment grow, the Internet has become
   popular as a major channel for providing a wide variety of information.
   However, users face the serious problem of information overload when
   acquiring increasing amounts of information from the Internet. This
   problem is one of the most important issues in providing information
   services to meet users' requirements in an electronic commerce
   environment. In this paper, we propose an information push-delivery
   system, which applies fuzzy information retrieval and fuzzy similarity
   measurement to avoid the information overload problem. This proposed
   system is helpful for users to acquire suitable information from the
   Internet. An empirical investigation of the proposed system is
   implemented in this study. The results show that the degree of
   satisfaction for the received information for all participants was as
   high as 71\%, indicating that the proposed system can effectively
   provide correct and interesting information for users. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Scholarly communication is undergoing transformation under the
   confluence of many forces. The purpose of this article is to explore
   trends in transforming scholarly publishing and their implications. It
   examines how collaboration and volume of information production were
   changed over the past century. It also explores how older documents are
   used under today's network environment where new information is easily
   accessible. Understanding these trends would help us design more
   effective electronic scholarly publishing systems and digital libraries,
   and serve the needs of scholars more responsively. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The emergence of Web-based IR systems calls for the need to support
   ease-of-use as well as user control. This study attempts to investigate
   users' perceptions of ease-of-use versus user control, and desired
   functionalities as well as desired interface structure of online IR
   systems in supporting both ease-of-use and user control. Forty subjects
   who had an opportunity to learn and use five online databases
   participated in the study. Multiple methods were employed to collect
   data. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data show that
   users consider both ease-of-use and user control are essential for
   effective retrieval. The results are discussed within the context of a
   model of optimal support for ease-of-use and user control, particularly,
   emphasizing on the balance between system role and user involvement in
   achieving various IR sub-tasks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article and two other articles which conceptualize a future
   stage of the research program (Leide, Cole, Large, \& Beheshti,
   submitted for publication; Cole, Leide, Large, Beheshti, \& Brooks, in
   preparation), we map-out a domain novice user's encounter with an IR
   system from beginning to end so that appropriate classification-based
   visualization schemes can be inserted into the encounter process. This
   article describes the visualization of a navigation classification
   scheme only. The navigation classification scheme uses the metaphor of a
   ship and ship's navigator traveling through charted (but unknown to the
   user) waters, guided by a series of lighthouses. The lighthouses contain
   mediation interfaces linking the user to the information store through
   agents created for each. The user's agent is the cognitive model the
   user has of the information space, which the system encourages to evolve
   via interaction with the system's agent. The system's agent is an
   evolving classification scheme created by professional indexers to
   represent the structure of the information store. We propose a more
   systematic, multidimensional approach to creating evolving
   classification/indexing schemes, based on where the user is and what she
   is trying to do at that moment during the search session. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper presents the multi-streams paradigm as a technique for
   improving speech signal feature set design and as a performance booster
   for speech recognition systems, based on the continuous-density hidden
   Markov model (CHMM) framework. In the multi-streams paradigm we are
   dealing with different feature sets independently to estimate the same
   task, and then combining their results at a suitable stage. This
   paradigm combines the strengths of many varied feature vectors to attain
   better statistical estimation. Under the proposed paradigm the feature
   vectors are split into three independent streams, and each stream is
   used to model an independent CHMM. Then the outcomes of these models,
   when subjected to any speech input, are merged under a certain strategy.
   This technique alleviates the dominance effect of the features, and
   reduces the dimensionality of the feature vectors used in each model.
   The F-ratio technique is used to further reduce the dimensionality of
   each stream. Experimental results on different datasets show superiority
   of the developed paradigm over the corresponding single-stream baseline.

Abstract = {{We have been investigating for some time the use of a layered
   modular/ensemble neural network architecture for acoustic modelling. In
   the particular instantiation investigated so far, this architecture
   decomposes the task of acoustic modelling by phone. In a first layer at
   least one multilayer perceptron (or `primary detector') is trained to
   discriminate each phone and, in a second layer, outputs from the first
   layer are combined into posterior probabilities by further MLPs. In this
   paper we show how our approach provides good acoustic modelling in a
   series of experiments on the TIMIT speech corpus. Firstly we show that
   decomposition itself provides a gain through greater precision in MLP
   training. Secondly we show that primary detectors trained on different
   front-ends can be profitably combined. Our analysis of the correlations
   between different detectors for the same phone shows that some
   independent information is provided by different front-ends. Thirdly we
   show how to employ information from a wide context within our
   architectural framework and that this provides performance equivalent to
   the best context-dependent acoustic modelling systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Neural network learning theory draws a relationship between ``learning
   with noise{''} and applying a regularization term in the cost function
   that is minimized during the training process on clean (non-noisy) data.
   Application of regularizers and other robust training techniques are
   aimed at improving the generalization capabilities of connectionist
   models, reducing overfitting. In spite of that, the generalization
   problem is usually overlooked by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
   practioners who use hidden Markov models (HMM) or other standard ASR
   paradigms. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that an adequate
   neural network model (due to its universal approximation property and
   generalization capability) along with a suitable regularizer can exhibit
   good recognition performance whenever noise is added to the test data,
   although training is accomplished on clean data. This paper presents
   applications of a variant of the so called segmental neural network
   (SNN), introduced at BBN by Zavaliagkos et at. for rescoring the N-best
   hypothesis yielded by a standard continuous density HMM (CDHMM). An
   enhanced connectionist model, called SNN with trainable amplitude of
   activation functions (SNN-TA) is first used in this paper instead of the
   CDHMM to perform the recognition of isolated words. Viterbi-based
   segmentation is then introduced, relying on the level-building
   algorithm, that can be combined with the SNN-TA to obtain a hybrid
   framework for continuous speech recognition. The proposed paradigm is
   applied to the recognition of isolated and connected Italian digits
   under several noisy conditions, outperforming the CDHMMs. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The paper presents a novel approach towards building adaptive speech
   recognition systems based on the evolving connectionist systems paradigm
   (ECoS). The simple evolving connectionist systems are the minimalist
   implementation of the ECoS. They can accommodate new input data and new
   classes through local element tuning. New connections and neurons are
   created during the adaptive learning process of the system. Experiments
   are conducted to illustrate this concept. It is demonstrated that a
   system can adapt to new speakers data and add new output classes
   on-line, e.g. new words, added at any time of its operation without
   having to rebuild the network from ``scratch{''}. The system is robust
   to forgetting when new words are added. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

   English and New Zealand Maori speech. This is performed using true
   on-line learning in a connectionist architecture. The study represents a
   joint collaborative analysis, which applies the bilingual data as
   training examples to a connectionist-based evolving clustering method
   algorithm. The algorithm returns a structure containing acoustic
   clusters plotted using visualization techniques that could be used as
   the foundations for future speech classification systems. The following
   experiments are based on the notion that approximately 75\% of the
   phonological units in New Zealand English and New Zealand Maori occupy
   similar acoustic space, they sound the same, and therefore they can be
   used to classify new unknown speech units or words. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We examine the role of hyperplane ranking during genetic search by
   developing a metric for measuring the degree of ranking that exists with
   respect to static hyperplane averages taken directly from the function,
   as well as the dynamic ranking of hyperplanes during genetic search. We
   show that the degree of dynamic ranking induced by a simple genetic
   algorithm is highly correlated with the degree of static ranking that is
   inherent in the function, especially during the initial generations of
   search. The phi metric is designed to measure the consistency of an
   arbitrary ranking of hyperplanes in a partition with respect to a target
   string. Walsh coefficients can be calculated for small functions in
   order to characterize sources of linear and nonlinear interactions.
   Correlations between the phi metric and convergence behavior of a simple
   genetic algorithm are studied over large sets of functions with varying
   degrees of nonlinearity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new approach, HIerarchical DEcision Rules
   (HIDER), for learning generalizable rules in continuous and discrete
   domains based on evolutionary algorithms. The main contributions of our
   approach are the integration of both binary and real evolutionary
   coding; the use of specific operators; the relaxing coefficient to
   construct more flexible classifiers by indicating how general, with
   respect to the errors, decision rules must be; the coverage factor in
   the fitness function, which makes possible a quick expansion of the rule
   size; and the implicit hierarchy when rules are being obtained. HIDER is
   accuracy-aware since it can control the maximum allowed error for each
   decision rule. We have tested our system on real data from the UCI
   Repository. The results of a 10-fold cross-validation are compared to
   C4.5's and they show a significant improvement with respect to the

Abstract = {{Genetic algorithms (GAs) are well-known heuristic algorithms and have
   been applied to solve a variety of complicated problems. When adopting
   GA approaches, two important issues-selection pressure and population
   diversity-must be considered. This work presents a novel mating
   strategy, called tabu genetic algorithm (TGA), which harmonizes these
   two issues by integrating tabu search (TS) into GA's selection. TGA
   incorporates the tabu list to prevent inbreeding so that population
   diversity can be maintained, and further utilizes the aspiration
   criterion to supply moderate selection pressure. An accompanied
   self-adaptive mutation method is also proposed to overcome the
   difficulty of determining mutation rate, which is sensitive to computing
   performance. The classic traveling salesman problem is used as a
   benchmark to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
   Experimental results indicate that TGA can achieve harmony between
   population diversity and selection pressure. Comparisons with GA, TS,
   and hybrids of GA and TS further confirm the superiority of TGA in terms
   of both solution quality and convergence speed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Due to the inherently distributed nature of many networks, including the
   Internet, information and knowledge are generated and organized
   independently by different groups of people. To discover and exploit all
   the knowledge from different sources, a method of knowledge integration
   is usually required. Considering the document category sets as
   information sources, we define a problem of information integration
   called category merging. The purpose of category merging is to
   automatically construct a unified category set which represents and
   exploits document information from several different sources. This
   merging process is based on the clustering concept where categories with
   similar characteristics are merged into the same cluster under certain
   distributed constraints. To evaluate the quality of the merged category
   set, we measure the precision and recall values under three
   classification methods, Naive Bayes, Vector Space Model, and K-Nearest
   Neighbor. In addition, we propose a performance measure called cluster
   entropy, which determines how well the categories from different sources
   are distributed over the resulting clusters. We perform the merging
   process by using the real data sets collected from three different Web
   directories. The results show that our merging process improves the
   classification performance over the non-merged approach and also
   provides a better representation for all categories from distributed
   directories. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many scientific experiments produce large amounts of data using
   high-throughput devices. Knowledge Discovery systems are used in order
   to analyse this type of data. However, generic laboratory systems do not
   provide any contextual information about the system that is being
   studied. In these situations, Knowledge Discovery can be aided and
   validated by the use of Information integration tools. In this paper, we
   introduce InfoGrid, a data integration middleware engine, designed to
   operate under a Grid framework. It focuses on providing information
   access services and offers all users a query system which is able to
   retain the familiarity with their specific scientific applications while
   being diverse, flexible and open at the same time. The assumption here
   is that defining a common language for all queries is not desirable.
   Using this design, we show how the InfoGrid architecture can be used to
   provide contextual features for a data table to be used for analysis
   (i.e. the Annotation Problem). We also show how it can be used to find
   relevant background knowledge for a user (i.e. the Information
   Comprehension Problem). Both of these issues are very often encountered
   in Knowledge Discovery tasks, which we illustrate by means of a
   real-world example. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Information from which knowledge can be discovered is frequently
   distributed due to having been recorded at different times or to having
   arisen from different sources. Such information is often subject to both
   imprecision and uncertainty. The Dempster-Shafer representation of
   evidence offers a way of representing uncertainty in the presence of
   imprecision, and may therefore be used to provide a mechanism for
   storing imprecise and uncertain information in databases. We consider an
   extended relational data model that allows the imprecision and
   uncertainty associated with attribute values to be quantified using a
   mass function distribution. When a query is executed, it may be
   necessary to combine imprecise and uncertain data from distributed
   sources in order to answer that query. A mechanism is therefore required
   both for combining the data and for generating measures of uncertainty
   to be attached to the (imprecise) combined data. In this paper we
   provide such a mechanism based on aggregation of evidence. We show first
   how this mechanism can be used to resolve inconsistencies and hence
   provide an essential database capability to perform the operations
   necessary to respond to queries on imprecise and uncertain data. We go
   on to exploit the aggregation operator in an attribute-driven approach
   to provide information on properties of and patterns in the data. This
   is fundamental to rule discovery, and hence such an aggregation operator
   provides a facility that is a central requirement in providing a
   distributed information system with the capability to perform the
   operations necessary for Knowledge Discovery. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes an approach to data-driven discovery of decision
   trees or rules for assigning protein sequences to functional families
   using sequence motifs. This method is able to capture regularities that
   can be described in terms of presence or absence of arbitrary
   combinations of motifs. A training set of peptidase sequences labeled
   with the corresponding MEROPS functional families or clans is used to
   automatically construct decision trees that capture regularities
   sufficient to assign the sequences to their respective functional
   families. The performance of the resulting decision tree classifiers is
   then evaluated on an independent test set. We compared the rules
   constructed using motifs generated by a multiple sequence alignment
   based motif discovery tool (MEME) with rules constructed using expert
   annotated PROSITE Motifs (patterns and profiles). Our results indicate
   that the former provide a potentially powerful high throughput technique
   for constructing protein function classifiers when adequate training
   data are available. Examination of the generated rules in relation to
   known three-dimensional structures of members in the case of two
   families (MEROPS families C14 and M12) suggests that the proposed
   technique may be able to identify combinations of sequence - motifs that
   characterize functionally significant three-dimensional structural
   features of proteins. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new fuzzy controller for anti-swing and position control of an
   overhead traveling crane is proposed based on the Single Input Rule
   Modules (SIRMs) dynamically connected fuzzy inference model. The trolley
   position and velocity, the rope swing angle and angular velocity are
   selected as the input items, and the trolley acceleration as the output
   item. Each input item is given with a SIRM and a dynamic importance
   degree. The control system is proved to be asymptotically stable to the
   destination. The controller is robust to different rope lengths and has
   generalization ability for different initial positions. Control
   simulation results show that by using the fuzzy controller, the crane is
   smoothly driven to the destination in short time with small swing angle
   and almost no overshoot. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In distributed autonomous robot (agents) systems, each robot (predator
   or prey) must behave by itself according to its states and environments,
   and if necessary, must cooperate with other robots in order to carry out
   a given task. Therefore it is essential that each robot have both
   learning and evolution ability to adapt to dynamic environment. This
   paper proposes a pursuing system utilizing the artificial life concept
   where autonomous mobile robots emulate social behaviors of animals and
   insects and realize their group behaviors. Each robot contains sensors
   to perceive other robots in several directions and decides its behavior
   based on the information obtained by the sensors. In this paper, a
   neural network is used for behavior decision controller. The input of
   the neural network is decided by the existence of other robots and the
   distance to the other robots. The output determines the directions in
   which the robot moves. The connection weight values of this neural
   network are encoded as genes, and the fitness individuals are determined
   using a genetic algorithm. Here, the fitness values imply how much group
   behaviors fit adequately to the goal and can express group behaviors.
   The validity of the system is verified through simulation. Besides, in
   this paper, we could have observed the robots' emergent behaviors during
   simulation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   results show that a system using the extracted adaptation knowledge
   provided higher precision of solution than a system supporting only case

Abstract = {{Technophobia has been an enduring problem in industrial economies over
   the last 20 years. Though explanatory models have been proposed to
   explain the prevalence of technophobia, these efforts have been diffuse,
   contradictory, and lacking in integration and explanatory and predictive
   utility. Using technophobia as the background variable, this research
   examines the role of scaling and framing in organizational research. It
   is argued that these particular issues, though endemic to research in
   other areas of social sciences as well, are worthy of exploration in the
   context of technophobia particularly in light of contradictory findings.

Abstract = {{Fuzzy random variable is a measurable mapping from a probability space
   to a collection of fuzzy variables. This concept may be regard as an
   extension of both random variable and fuzzy variable. In this paper, the
   linearity of a scalar value expected value operator of fuzzy random
   variable is discussed, and a fuzzy random simulation approach is
   suggested to evaluate the expected value of a fuzzy random variable. In
   addition, three types of fuzzy random expected value models are
   presented to model fuzzy random decision systems. Moreover, a hybrid
   intelligent algorithm, which incorporates simulation, neural network and
   genetic algorithm, is designed in order to solve general fuzzy random
   expected value models. At the end of this paper, the effectiveness of
   this algorithm is showed via three numerical examples. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The cartesian product and disjoint sum of graphs play a prominent role
   and have numerous interesting algebraic properties. In this note, we
   consider operations on fuzzy graphs under which M-strong property is
   preserved. If G(1) and G(2) are M-strong fuzzy graphs then we prove that
   G(1) x G(2), G(1){[}G(2)] and G(1) + G(2) are also M-strong but G(1)
   boolean OR G(2) need not be M-strong. If G(1) x G(2) is M-strong then we
   show that at least one factor must be M-strong. We show that the product
   of a M-strong fuzzy graph G(1) with a non-M-strong fuzzy graph G(2)
   remains M-strong if and only if G(2) satisfies special condition. For
   any fuzzy graph G, G(Cc) is the smallest M-strong fuzzy graph that
   contains G and G = G(Cc) if and only if G is M-strong. We further show
   that M-strong fuzzy graph G is a fuzzy tree if and only if the
   support(G) is a tree. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A modified Euclidean decoding algorithm to solve the Berlekamp's key
   equation of Reed-Solomon code for correcting errors, is presented in
   this paper. It is derived to solve the error locator and evaluator
   polynomials simultaneously without performing the operations of
   polynomial division and field element inversion. In this algorithm, the
   number of iterations used to solve the equation is fixed, and also the
   weights used to reduce the degree of the error evaluator polynomial at
   each iteration can be extracted from the coefficient of fixed degree.
   Therefore, this proposed algorithm saves many controlling circuits, and
   provides module architecture with regularity. As a result it is simple
   and easy to implement, and in addition it can be easily configured for
   various applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Author searching is traditionally based on the matching of name strings.
   Special characteristics of authors as personal names and subject
   indicators are not considered. This makes it difficult to identify a set
   of related authors or to group authors by subjects in retrieval systems.
   In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a prototype
   visualization system to enhance author searching. The system, called
   AuthorLink, is based on author co-citation analysis and visualization
   mapping algorithms such as Kohonen's feature maps and Pathfinder
   networks. AuthorLink produces interactive author maps in real time from
   a database of 1.26 million records supplied by the Institute for
   Scientific Information. The maps show subject groupings and more
   fine-grained intellectual connections among authors. Through the
   interactive interface the user can take advantage of such information to
   refine queries and retrieve documents through point-and-click
   manipulation of the authors' names. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of the work described in this paper is to evaluate the
   influencing effects of query-biased summaries in web searching. For this
   purpose, a summarisation system has been developed, and a summary
   tailored to the user's query is generated automatically for each
   document retrieved. The system aims to provide both a better means of
   assessing document relevance than titles or abstracts typical of many
   web search result lists. Through visiting each result page at
   retrieval-time, the system provides the user with an idea of-the current
   page content and thus deals with the dynamic nature of the web.
   To examine the effectiveness of this approach, a task-oriented,
   comparative evaluation between four different web retrieval systems was
   performed; two that use query-biased summarisation, and two that use the
   standard ranked titles/abstracts approach. The results from the
   evaluation indicate that query-biased summarisation techniques appear to
   be more useful and effective in helping users gauge document relevance
   than the traditional ranked titles/abstracts approach. The same
   methodology was used to compare the effectiveness of two of the web's
   major search engines; AltaVista and Google. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{While surprisingly little has been written about context at a meaningful
   level, context is central to most theoretical approaches to information
   seeking. In this essay I explore in more detail three senses of context.
   First, I look at context as equivalent to the situation in which a
   process is immersed. Second, I discuss contingency approaches that
   detail active ingredients of the situation that have specific,
   predictable effects. Third, I examine major frameworks for meaning
   systems. Then, I discuss how a deeper appreciation of context can
   enhance our understanding of the process of information seeking by
   examining two vastly different contexts in which it occurs:
   organizational and cancer-related, an exemplar of everyday life
   information seeking. This essay concludes with a discussion of the value
   that can be added to information seeking research and theory as a result
   of a deeper appreciation of context, particularly in terms of our
   current multi-contextual environment and individuals taking an active
   role in contextualizing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Burrell (Scientometrics, 55 (2003) in press) has pointed out certain
   similarities between retrospective citation age studies and reliability
   theory. Here we extend these connections by considering the so-called
   failure rate function from reliability which is re-interpreted as the
   age-specific citation rate (ASCR). This is linked to earlier studies of
   retrospective citation distributions by Egghe and Ravichandra Rao
   (Information Processing and Management 28 (1992) 201) who introduced a
   function claimed to correspond to what they termed the (discrete time)
   obsolescence or ageing function. Further analysis reveals that their
   function is essentially one whose behaviour reflects that of the ASCR.

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Ordered sets of documents are encountered more and more in information
   distribution systems, such as information retrieval systems. Classical
   similarity measures for ordinary sets of documents hence need to be
   extended to these ordered sets. This is done in this paper using fuzzy
   set techniques. First a general similarity measure is developed which
   contains the classical strong similarity measures such as Jaccard, Dice,
   Cosine and which contains the classical weak similarity measures such as
   Recall and Precision.
   Then these measures are extended to comparing fuzzy sets of documents.
   Measuring the similarity for ordered sets of documents is a special case
   of this, where, the higher the rank of a document, the lower its weight
   is in the fuzzy set. Concrete forms of these similarity measures are
   presented. All these measures are new and the ones for the weak
   similarity measures are the first of this kind (other strong similarity
   measures have been given in a previous paper by Egghe and Michel).
   Some of these measures are then tested in the IR-system Profil-Doc. The
   engine SPIRIT(C) extracts ranked documents sets in three different
   contexts, each for 600 request. The practical useability of the
   OS-measures is then discussed based on these experiments. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The strength of a program for playing an adversary game like chess or
   checkers is greatly influenced by how selectively it explores the
   various branches of the game tree. Typically, some branch paths are
   discontinued early while others are explored more deeply. Finding the
   best set of parameters to control these extensions is a difficult,
   time-consuming, and tedious task. In this paper we describe a method for
   automatically tuning search-extension parameters in adversary search.
   Based on the new method, two learning variants are introduced: one for
   offline learning and the other for online learning. The two approaches
   are compared and experimental results provided in the domain of chess.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Opponent-model (OM) search comes with two types of risk. The first type
   is caused by a player's imperfect knowledge of the opponent, the second
   type arises from low-quality evaluation functions. In this paper, we
   investigate the desirability of a precondition, called admissibility,
   that may prevent the second type of risk. We examine the results of two
   sets of experiments: the first set is taken from the game of LOA, and
   the second set from the KQKR chess endgame. The LOA experiments show
   that when admissibility happens to be absent, the OM results are not
   positive. The chess experiments demonstrate that when an admissible pair
   of evaluation functions is available, OM search performs better than
   minimax, provided that there is sufficient room to make errors.
   Furthermore, we conclude that the expectation `the better the quality of
   the prediction of the opponent's move, the more successful OM search is'
   is only true if the quality of both evaluation functions is sufficiently
   high. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of the the killer-tree heuristic

   Both techniques are developed to be used in the endgame of shogi. They
   are incorporated into two depth-first searches: iterative deepening
   alphabeta and PDS. lambda(1)-Search, in which the move generation is
   limited to lambda(1)-moves, shows a poor ability to find winning
   solutions. When using lambda(1)-sorting, in which lambda(1)-moves are
   put at the front of the move list, the number of nodes searched is
   reduced considerably, but the solving ability is diminished because of
   the inefficiency of the move generation. Using the KTH, the number of
   nodes searched and the solving time are reduced by 5\% in iterative
   deepening alphabeta and by 20\% in PDS. Consequently, the solving
   ability has been enhanced. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Conditional combinatorial games (CCG) are a new tool developed for
   describing loosely coupled games. The definition of CCG is based on the
   one for classical independent combinatorial games. However, play in a
   CCG depends on its global context: certain moves are legal only if a
   nonlocal context condition is currently true. Compared with independent
   combinatorial games, CCG only allow some weaker forms of pruning. The
   first part of this paper starts to develop a theory of CCG and gives
   some examples.
   In the second part, CCG are shown to be useful for studying capturing
   races called semeai in the game of Go. We introduce a general framework
   for analyzing semeai, which is based on CCG and on an extension called
   liberty count games. We show how this framework encompasses and extends
   our earlier work on solving semeai {[}M. Muller, Race to capture:

Abstract = {{A mobile environment is characterized by low communication bandwidth and
   poor network connectivity. Accessing web documents in a mobile
   environment is thus both inefficient and ineffective. To combat for the
   low bandwidth problem, we employ the multi-resolution transmission and
   browsing mechanism for web documents, in which a web document is
   partitioned into multiple units, to enable a mobile client to explore
   the more content-bearing portion earlier. To combat for the poor network
   connectivity problem, we utilize a mobile agent model in the distributed
   agent environment (DAE). A mobile agent has the capability of migrating
   to a base station that is currently serving a mobile client,
   establishing a virtual connection to the client. The agent, acting on
   behalf of the client, travels along the wired network to carry out its
   tasks and collect results, returning to the client at the end of its
   itinerary. We have implemented the DAE architecture, which supports
   mobile agent in a mobile environment, and demonstrated its usefulness in
   supporting our multi-resolution mechanism. We have also conducted
   experimental study, comparing performance between conventional mobile
   client/server model and different mobile agent models in accessing a
   database server through both wireless and wired networks. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Application programs are performed on clients while issuing requests to
   object servers. Then, the object servers send responses to the clients.
   On the other hand, programs named agents move to object servers where
   the agents can manipulate objects in a mobile agent approach. If agents
   complete manipulating objects in the servers, the agents move to other
   object servers. If an agent conflicts with other agents on an object
   server, the agents negotiate with each other to resolve the confliction.
   If the object servers are faulty, agent find another object server where
   the agent can be performed. Each agent has its own commitment condition
   like atomic and at-least-one conditions. For example, an agent can
   commit if the agent successfully manipulate at least one object server.
   In this paper, we discuss how to perform agents with different
   constraints on multiple object servers in presence of servers and agent
   faults. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{154}},

Pages = {{39-58}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The increasing availability of image and multimedia-oriented
   applications markedly impacts image/multimedia file and database
   systems. Image data are not well-defined keywords such as traditional
   text data used in searching and retrieving functions. Consequently,
   various indexing and retrieving methodologies must be defined based on
   the characteristics of image data. Spatial relationships represent an
   important feature of objects (called icons) in an image (or picture).
   Spatial representation by 2D String and its variants, in a pictorial
   spatial database, has been attracting growing interest. However, most 2D
   Strings represent spatial information by cutting the icons out of an
   image and associating them with many spatial operators. The similarity
   retrievals by 2D Strings require massive geometric computation and focus
   only on those database images that have all the icons and spatial
   relationships of the query image. This study proposes a new
   spatial-relationship representation model called ``two dimension
   begin-end boundary string{''} (2D Be-string). The 2D Be-string
   represents an icon by its MBR boundaries. By applying ``dummy
   objects{''}, the 2D Be-string can intuitively and naturally represent
   the pictorial spatial information without any spatial operator. A method
   of evaluating image similarities, based on the modified ``longest common
   subsequence{''} algorithm, is presented. The proposed evaluation method
   cannot only sift out those images of which all icons and their spatial
   relationships fully accord with query images, but for those images some
   of whose icons and/or spatial relationships are similar to those of
   query images. Problems of uncertainty the query targets and/or spatial
   relationships thus solved. The representation model and similarity
   evaluation also simplify the retrieval progress of linear
   transformations, including rotation and reflection, of images. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The extension of reinforcement learning (RL) to large state space has
   inevitably encountered the problem of the curse of dimensionality.
   Improving the learning efficiency of the agent is much more important to
   the practical application of RL. Consider learning to optimally solve
   Markov decision problems in a particular domain, if the domain has
   particular characteristics that are attributable to each state, the
   agent might be able to take advantage of these features to direct the
   future learning. This paper firstly defines the local state feature,
   then a state feature function is used to generate the local state
   features of a state. Also a weight function is introduced to adjust
   current policy to the actions worth exploring. Based on the above, an
   improved SARSA algorithm, Feature-SARSA, is proposed. We validate our
   new algorithm by experiment on a complex domain, named Sokoban. The
   results show that the new algorithm has better performance. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The advance in computer graphics and networking technologies leads to
   the development of distributed virtual environment (DVE), which allow
   remote users to share information and interact within a common virtual
   environment via a local area network or through the Internet. A DVE
   system needs to perform many tasks, such as processing of clients'
   requests, synchronization, object transmission and interaction handling.
   However, the workload induced by these tasks may become significant in a
   large scale DVE, where there may be a large number of concurrent users.
   In such situation, a single server based DVE system may not have enough
   processing power to maintain the system interactivity. To address this
   problem, a number of multi-server based DVE systems have been developed.
   In this paper, we explore how existing multi-server based DVE systems
   manage large scale DVEs and discuss various issues for implementing a
   multi-server based DVE system. We study the performance of such a system
   under various conditions via several simulated experiments. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Most previous information retrieval (IR) models assume that terms of
   queries and documents are statistically independent from each another.
   However, this kind of conditional independence assumption is obviously
   and openly understood to be wrong, so we present a new method of
   incorporating term dependence in probabilistic retrieval model by
   adapting Bahadur-Lazarsfeld expansion (BLE) to compensate the weakness
   of the assumption. In this paper, we describe a theoretic process to
   apply BLE to the general probabilistic models and the state-of-the-art
   2-Poisson model. Through the experiments on two standard document
   collections, HANTEC2.0 in Korean and WT10g in English, we demonstrate
   that incorporation of term dependences using the BLE significantly
   contribute to the improvement of performance in at least two different
   language IR systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Addressed here is the issue of `topic analysis' which is used to
   determine a text's topic structure, a representation indicating what
   topics are included in a text and how those topics change within the
   text. Topic analysis consists of two main tasks: topic identification
   and text segmentation. While topic analysis would be extremely useful in
   a variety of text processing applications, no previous study has so far
   sufficiently addressed it. A statistical learning approach to the issue
   is proposed in this paper. More specifically, topics here are
   represented by means of word clusters, and a finite mixture model,
   referred to as a stochastic topic model (STM), is employed to represent
   a word distribution within a text. In topic analysis, a given text is
   segmented by detecting significant differences between STMs, and topics
   are identified by means of estimation of STMs. Experimental results
   indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms methods that
   combine existing techniques. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new method to improve the performance of
   query processing in a spatial database. The previous approach can
   process the retrieval of spatial objects by topological relations using
   R-tree structures based on minimum bounding rectangles. In our approach,
   we add internal rectangle to the leaf nodes of the R-tree as additional
   information for helping objects retrieval. As a result, the number of
   false hits can be reduced and part of the true hits can be identified at
   the early stage of searching. The experiments demonstrated that the
   performance of database systems can be improved because both the number
   of objects accessed and the number of objects requiring detailed
   inspection are much less than those in the previous approach. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Metasearching of online current news services is a potentially useful
   Web application of distributed information retrieval techniques. We
   constructed a realistic current news test collection using the results
   obtained from 15 current news Web sites (including ABC News, BBC and
   AllAfrica) in response to 107 topical queries. Results were judged for
   relevance by independent assessors. Online news services varied
   considerably both in the usefulness of the results sets they returned
   and also in the amount of information they provided which could be
   exploited by a metasearcher. Using the current news test collection we
   compared a range of different merging methods. We found that a low-cost
   merging scheme based on a combination of available evidence (title,
   summary, rank and server usefulness) worked almost as well as merging
   based on downloading and rescoring the actual news articles. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Multimedia is proliferating on Web sites, as the Web continues to
   enhance the integration of multimedia and textual information. In this
   paper we examine trends in multimedia Web searching by Excite users from
   1997 to 2001. Results from an analysis of 1,025,910 Excite queries from
   2001 are compared to similar Excite datasets from 1997 to 1999. Findings
   include: (1) queries per multimedia session have decreased since 1997 as
   a proportion of general queries due to the introduction of multimedia
   buttons near the query box, (2) multimedia queries identified are longer
   than non-multimedia queries, and (3) audio queries are more prevalent
   than image or video queries in identified multimedia queries. Overall,
   we see multimedia Web searching undergoing major changes as Web content
   and searching evolves. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new extraction pattern, called modified Document
   Type Definition (mDTD), which relies on analytical interpretation to
   identify extraction target from the contents of the Web documents. From
   conventional DTD in XML documents, we develop two major extensions:
   first, we introduce an extended content model with type-specific
   operators and keywords, and second, we refine the way to interpret the
   conventional DTD rules. As the result of the two, bur mDTD becomes
   freely represent HTML structures and extraction targets. The goal of
   mDTD is to overcome the current major barriers, that is, domain
   portability (with minimal human intervention) and high performance, on
   information extraction. The human experts compose an mDTD as seed rules,
   and then our system automatically extracts a set of instances by the
   mDTD from structured documents on the Web. We use the extracted
   instances as Sequential mDTD Learner (SmL) inputs to generate new mDTD
   rules based on part-of-speech tags and features for lexical similarity.
   This process does not require any hand-annotated corpus. We have
   experimented with 330 Korean and 220 English Web documents on audio and
   video shopping sites. The average extraction precision is 91.3\% for
   Korean and 81.9\% for English. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Information landscaping-an integration of information mapping, charting,
   querying and reporting techniques-has been developed to enable the
   construction of a total quality knowledge management system focusing on
   a particular subject information field. The techniques apply five major
   parameters of the Fuzzy commonality model.(FCM) including unionization,
   quantity, continuity or stability, changeability, and critical
   probability, to construct a series of information maps (infomaps) and a
   set of chronological-statistical charts (infocharts). The infomaps and
   infocharts are used as the blueprints and navigation agents for building
   and,developing a web-based subject experts depository and query-report
   system. Focusing on the subject experts/expertise, this system enables a
   researcher to expedite a query search through infomaps (qualitative
   reference) and infocharts (quantitative reference). The entropy
   measurement and the entropy constant (the square root of the average
   entropy measure) are calculated to compare with the critical probability
   of the FCM. This leads to the finding of a set of regression straight
   lines and the establishment of an information oscillogram. The tropics
   (upper limit, middle range, lower limit), and the potential/solstitial
   population and its growth rate within a subject information domain
   during a particular time period can be determined. They can effectively
   and efficiently guide librarians and information professionals towards
   the construction and the continuous development of an electronic
   collection. The cultivation of a virtual learning and referencing
   environment can also be created by utilizing this data. (C) 2002

Title = {{Experimental complexity analysis of continuous constraint satisfaction
   problems}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{1-36}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Continuous constraint satisfaction problems are at the core of many
   real-world applications, including planning, scheduling, control, and
   diagnosis of physical systems such as car, planes, and factories. Yet in
   order to be effective in such resource-constrained environments,
   constraint-based techniques must take into account the complexity of
   continuous constrained problems. In this paper, we study complexity
   phase transition phenomena of continuous constraint satisfaction
   problems (CSPs). First, we analyze three continuous constraint
   satisfaction formulations based on (discrete) 3-SAT problems, which have
   a strong relation between structure and search cost. Then, we propose a
   generic benchmarking model for comparing continuous CSPs and algorithms,
   and present two example problems based on sine functions. In our
   experiments, these problems are solved using both local and global
   search methods. Besides comparing the complexities of different
   continuous CSPs and search algorithms, we also connect these back to
   results from similar studies on SAT problems. In solving continuous
   3-SAT and sine-based CSPs, we find that the median search cost is
   characterized by simple parameters such as the constraint-to-variable
   ratio and constraint tightness, and that discrete search algorithms such
   as GSAT have continuous counter-parts with similar behavior. Regarding
   local versus global search techniques for constraint solving, our
   results show that local search methods are more efficient for weakly
   constrained problems, whereas global search methods work better on
   highly constrained problems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Title = {{Confirmation: Increasing resource availability for transactional
   workflows}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{37-53}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The notion of compensation is widely used in advanced transaction models
   as means of recovery from a failure. Similar concepts are adopted for
   providing ``transaction-like{''} behaviour for long business processes
   supported by workflows technology. In general, it is not trivial to
   design compensating tasks for tasks in the context of a workflow.
   Actually, a task in a workflow process does not have to be compensatable
   in the sense that the forcibility of ``reverse{''} operations of the
   task is not always guaranteed by the application semantics. In addition,
   the isolation requirement on data resources may make a task difficult to
   compensate. In this paper, we first look into the requirements that a
   compensating task has to satisfy. Then we introduce a new concept called
   confirmation. With the help of confirmation, we are able to modify most
   non-compensatable tasks so that they become compensatable. This can
   substantially increase the availability of shared resources and greatly
   improve backward recovery for workflow applications in case of failures.
   To effectively incorporate confirmation and compensation into a workflow
   management environment, a three level bottom-up workflow design method
   is introduced. The implementation issues of this design are also
   discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Pages = {{55-83}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In a distributed real-time database system, a remote transaction usually
   accesses some data located at remote sites. However, traditional
   real-time schedulers do not consider the impact of communication delay
   in transferring remote data, resulting in a high Miss Ratio for remote
   transactions. This study proposes a new real-time scheduler called
   flexible high reward (FHR) to reduce the Miss Ratio and lessen the
   unnecessary waiting time due to communication delay for a remote
   transaction. This scheduler gives a remote transaction a slightly higher
   priority and adjusts a remote transaction's waiting status such that the
   resources held by a waiting remote transaction can be released as soon
   as possible. Through the underlying operating system, local transactions
   can also be executed while a remote transaction is waiting for remote
   data. Simulation results demonstrate that the FHR outperforms current
   real-time schedulers such as earliest deadline, highest value, and
   highest reward and urgency. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the concept of a maximal consistent block is applied to
   formulate a new approximation to an object set in incomplete information
   systems with higher level of accuracy. Similar to the method in
   {[}Inform. Sci. 112 (1998) 39, 113 (1999) 271], the proposed
   rough-set-based rule acquisition method does not require change in the
   size of the original incomplete system. It, however, has the additional
   advantage of using a set of simpler discernibility functions of an
   incomplete system. This means that it can provide a more efficient
   computation for knowledge acquisition, especially in large incomplete

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{153}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Combination of pieces of information issued from different sources plays
   a central role in several engineering as well as academic applications.
   The challenge that was usually addressed in these topics is how to deal
   with uncertainty and imperfection pervading the different sources of
   knowledge as well as with conflictual pieces of information. The theory
   of t-norms and t-conorms have been intensively investigated by many
   authors (see, for instance {[}E.P. Klement, R. Mesiar, E. Pap,
   Triangular Norms, Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht, 2000]) because
   of their appealing properties to model and manage the basic combination
   modes referring to a conjunctive and a disjunctive modes. Hamacher's
   family of t-norms {[}E.P. Klement, R. Mesiar, E. Pap, Triangular Norms,
   Kluwer Academic Publisher, 2000] offers a special interest because it
   supplies a wide class of t-norm operators ranging from the probabilistic
   product to the weakest t-norm. Dubois and Prade {[}Data Fusion in
   Robotics and Machine Intelligence, Academic Press, New York; Contr. Eng.
   Practice 2 (1994) 812] have proposed an interesting setting for dealing
   with conflict based on the adaptiveness property that allows a gradual
   moving from a conjunctive mode to a disjunctive mode as soon as the
   conflict increases. This paper attempts to capture the basic ideas of
   the adaptiveness in order to build new combination rules based on
   Hamacher's family. Particularly, certainty based qualification {[}R.R.
   Yager, Expert systems using fuzzy logic, in: R.R. Yager, L. Zadeh
   (Eds.), Intelligent Systems, Kluwer Academic Publisher, 1992, 27] will
   be reviewed and, accordingly, two families of rules will be put forward
   and compared to the adaptive rule of Dubois' and Prade's. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This note addresses the problem of the multiplication (and division) of
   fuzzy numbers represented in LR (left and right) form. It is known that,
   usually, the multiplication of LR fuzzy numbers does not provide LR
   fuzzy number. However, for real time applications, for instance, the
   complexity of such operation often prevents the use of fuzzy arithmetic
   framework to these fields. This rises the question whether an
   approximated LR fuzzy number can be found in case of fuzzy
   multiplication (division) operation. This paper focuses on an
   approximated LR fuzzy number that agrees with the result supplied by the
   fuzzy multiplication (division) operation according to some rational
   criteria. These criteria involve properties of global specificity, high
   plausibility and typicality representation. Furthermore, the error
   induced by this approximation is evaluated and included as a constraint
   for the approximation issue. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{153}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fractal dimensions describe self-similarity (structural complexity) of
   various phenomena (such as e.g., temporal signals, images). Their
   determination (through box counting or a correlation method) is
   inherently associated with the use of information granules-sets. The
   intent of this study is to generalize the idea to the domain of fuzzy
   sets and reveal associations between the mechanisms of fractal analysis
   and granular computing (including fuzzy modeling). First, we introduce
   the concept itself and discuss the role of fuzzy sets as a vehicle for
   constructing fractal dimensions. Second, we propose an algorithmic
   framework necessary to carry out all computing. and experimentally
   quantify a performance of regression models used to determine fractal
   dimensions and contrast it with the performance of the fractal models
   existing in the set-based environment. It is shown that fuzzy set
   approach produces more consistent models (in terms of their
   performance). We also postulate a power law of granularity and discuss
   its direct implications in the form of a variable granularity in fuzzy
   modeling. In particular, we show how the power law of granularity helps
   construct mappings between system's variables in rule-based models.
   Experimental studies involving several frequently used categories of
   fuzzy sets illustrate the main features of the approach. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A systematic design methodology for integrating fuzzy modeling and
   adaptive control is proposed and developed in this paper. This design
   procedure provides a real-time system identification scheme using less
   fuzzy rules than that of the other existing methods due to a new
   sliding-mode learning mechanism embedded in the identified model, which
   has robust stability not only for stabilization of the identified system
   but also for trajectory tracking control. The integration of the
   identification and the adaptive control schemes ensures the suggested
   methodology overall advantageous and more attractive as compared to the
   other existing, usually separated, design approaches. Two typical
   complex systems are simulated, showing some convincing stabilization and
   tracking performance of the proposed integrated fuzzy system. (C) 2003

   one, our approach exploits human capabilities of pattern recognition in
   doing data analysis and selecting appropriate representations, features
   and class descriptions by means of interactive human-computer learning.
   It is based on the analysis of multidimensional relations through
   transforming the initial data (heterogeneous arrays, signals and fields)
   into artificial pictures. Practical applications of this approach prove
   it extremely useful in critical areas of safety, such as flight control,

Abstract = {{An important aspect of screen design is aesthetic evaluation of screen
   layouts. While it is conceivable to define a set of variables that
   characterize the key attributes of many alphanumeric display formats,
   such a task seems difficult for graphic displays because of their much
   greater complexity. This paper proposes a theoretical approach to
   capture the essence of artists' insights with 14 aesthetic measures for
   graphic displays. Our empirical study has suggested that these measures

Abstract = {{In prefetching, the objects that are expected to be accessed in the
   future are fetched from the server to the client in advance. Prefetching
   reduces the number of round-trips and increases the system performance.
   To prefetch object effectively, we need to correctly predict the future
   navigational patterns. In this paper, we propose the PrefetchGuide, a
   novel data structure that captures the navigational access patterns. We
   also formally define the notion of the attribute access log set and
   analyze the navigational access patterns that can be captured by the
   PrefetchGuide. We then present an prefetching algorithm using the
   PrefetchGuide. To show effectiveness of our algorithm, we have conducted
   extensive experiments in a prototype object-relational database
   management systems (DBMS). The results show that our method
   significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prefetching method. These
   results indicate that our approach provides a practical method that can
   be implemented in commercial object-oriented/object-relationaI DBMSs. We
   believe our method is practically usable for object-oriented programmers
   and DBMS implementors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A cryptographic key assignment scheme is proposed to enforce access
   control policies in which antisymmetric and transitive exceptions are
   included, in addition to the policies with partial ordered set (POSet)
   properties. In current literature, all proposed cryptographic key
   assignment schemes assume a user hierarchy model which can only enforce
   policies with POSet properties. The POSet properties are suitable for
   hierarchical systems. However, there are many systems, especially
   distributed systems handling indirect remote accesses, that cannot be
   modeled as a strict hierarchy. A new access control model named user
   hierarchy-with-exception and its enforcing key assignment scheme are
   proposed for those systems.
   There is only one key assigned to each user class in enforcing the user
   hierarchy model. The cost to achieve our more powerful scheme in the
   user hierarchy-with exception model is one more key for each user class
   to memorize or one more step to access its own data. Published by

Abstract = {{When testing a program, testers need to generate a set of test cases
   that satisfies a testing objective. This set of test cases is referred
   to as a test suite. Usually, the generated test suite may contain
   redundancy, that is, some test cases may be removed from the test suite
   without rendering the satisfaction of the testing objective. A
   representative set is a subset of a test suite that satisfies the same
   testing objective, and test suite reduction is aimed at finding the
   representative sets. This paper studies the properties of representative
   sets related to the divide-and-conquer approach towards test suite
   reduction. The results provide us a better understanding of the
   structural properties of representative sets and how to apply the
   divide-and-conquer approach towards test suite reduction. (C) 2003

Title = {{An aggregation algorithm using a multidimensional file in
   multidimensional OLAP}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{152}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aggregation is an operation that plays a key role in multidimensional
   OLAP (MOLAP). Existing aggregation methods in MOLAP have been proposed
   for file structures such as multidimensional arrays. These file
   structures are suitable for data with uniform distributions, but do not
   work well with skewed distributions. In this paper, we consider an
   aggregation method that uses dynamic multidimensional files adapting to
   skewed distributions. In these multidimensional files, the sizes of page
   regions vary according to the data density in these regions, and the
   pages that belong to a larger region are accessed multiple times while
   computing aggregations. To solve this problem, we first present an
   aggregation computation model that uses the new notions of
   disjoint-inclusive partition and induced space filling curves. Based on
   this model, we then present a dynamic aggregation algorithm. Using these
   notions, the algorithm allows us to maximize the effectiveness of the
   buffer-we control the page access order in such a way that a page being
   accessed can reside in the buffer until the next access. We have
   conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach.
   Experimental results for a real data set show that the algorithm reduces
   the number of disk accesses by up to 5.09 times compared with a naive
   algorithm. The results further show that the algorithm achieves a near
   optimal performance (i.e., normalized I/O = 1.01) with the total main
   memory (needed for the buffer and the result table) less than 1.0\% of
   the database size. We believe our work also provides an excellent formal
   basis for investigating further issues in computing aggregations in

Abstract = {{We construct a positive implication algebra PI(A) inherited from a

   using the special set del(a,b), we give a necessary and sufficient
   condition for V to be an implicative filter. We also introduce the
   notion of a V-type positive implication algebra, and prove the
   followings: (1) every del-type positive implication algebra is a
   commutative monoid under the operation (D, but not a group; (2) every
   V-type positive implication algebra is a lower semilattice; (3) in a
   V-type positive implication algebra the class of implicative filters
   coincides with the class of convex subsemigroups with V. Finally we show
   that every V-type positive implication algebra is a semi-Brouwerian
   algebra, and consider the direct product of implicative algebras. (C)

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates some basic properties of covering generalized
   rough sets, and their comparison with the corresponding ones of Pawlak's
   rough sets, a tool for data mining. The focus here is on the concepts
   and conditions for two coverings to generate the same covering lower
   approximation or the same covering upper approximation. The concept of
   reducts of coverings is introduced and the procedure to find a reduct
   for a covering is given. It has been proved that the reduct of a
   covering is the minimal covering that generates the same covering lower
   approximation or the same covering upper approximation, so this concept
   is also a technique to get rid of redundancy in data mining.
   Furthermore, it has been shown that covering lower and upper
   approximations determine each other. Finally, a set of axioms is
   constructed to characterize the covering lower approximation operation.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the concept of a fuzzy delta-epsilon-partitions of any
   fuzzy subset of the universe Q is introduced as a generalization of that
   of a classical partition. The approach is based on four observations:
   the first one is that for any two members of a classical partition,
   their intersection is the empty set if they are not equal; the second
   one is that the union of all embers of a classical partition is equal to
   the partitioned set; the third one is that this definition has to be
   applicable for any extension of the union and intersection for fuzzy
   subsets; and the fourth one is that this definition has to allow us to
   establish a one-to-one correspondence between fuzzy partitions and some
   kind of fuzzy equivalence relations. Once this new concept is
   introduced, by considering that the constrains for union and
   intersection are too limiting, and that they have to be slightly
   modified, some equivalence definitions of delta-epsilon-partitions are
   proposed. In particular, two very important cases are studied, they are
   the case when 6 is equal to e, because this is very useful in practical
   applications, and the case when 6 is equal to 1 - epsilon, that is, when
   the degree of fuzziness for the union and the intersection are equal.
   This case is very useful in theoretical applications and it will be
   related to the concept of E-equal fuzzy subsets. Apart from the fact
   that they are a generalization of that of a classical partition, the new
   concept of delta-epsilon-partition is also a generalization of that of
   the best known definitions of fuzzy partitions proposed in the
   literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to cope with parametric uncertainties of,= nonlinear systems, a
   numerical analysis method of a robust feedback linearization control
   scheme based on fuzzy models is proposed. The fuzzy feedback
   linearization control scheme ensures that the control operates stably
   under bounded parametric uncertainties. For the system with known
   uncertainty bounds, linear matrix inequality based robust stability
   condition is derived and a robust fuzzy feedback linearization
   regulators can be designed by choosing the control parameters satisfying
   the inequalities which give sufficient conditions for the closed loop
   system to be stable. To verify the validity and effectiveness of the
   designed stability analysis methods, the suggested analysis techniques
   are applied to a balancing control of inverted pendulum systems. (C)

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to describe an exploration system for large
   image databases in order to help the user understand the database as a
   whole, discover hidden relationships, and formulate insights with
   minimum effort. While the proposed system works with any type of
   low-level feature representation of images, we describe our system using
   color information. The system is built in three stages: the feature
   extraction stage in which images are represented in a way that allows
   efficient storage and retrieval results closer to the human perception;
   the second stage consists of building a hierarchy of clusters in which
   the cluster prototype, as the electronic identification (eID) of that
   cluster, is designed to summarize the cluster in a manner that is suited
   for quick human comprehension of its components. In a formal definition,
   an electronic IDentification (eID) is the most similar image to the
   other images from a corresponding cluster; that is, the image in the
   cluster that. maximizes the sum of the squares of the similarity values
   to the other images of that cluster. Besides summarizing the image
   database to a certain level of detail, an eID image will be a way to
   provide access either to another set of eID images on a lower level of
   the hierarchy or to a group of perceptually similar images with itself.
   As a third stage, the multi-dimensional scaling technique is used to
   provide us with a tool for the visualization of the database at
   different levels of details. Moreover, it gives the capability for
   semi-automatic annotation in the sense that the image database is
   organized in such a way that perceptual similar images are grouped
   together to form perceptual contexts. As a result, instead of trying to
   give all possible meanings to an image, the user will interpret and
   annotate an image in the context in which that image appears, thus
   dramatically reducing the time taken to annotate large collection of
   images. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised text
   summarization, which in principle should work for any domain or genre.
   The novelty lies in exploiting the diversity of concepts in text for
   summarization, which has not received much attention in the
   summarization literature.
   We propose, in addition, what we call the information-centric approach
   to evaluation, where the quality of summaries is judged not in terms of
   how well they match human-created summaries but in terms of how well
   they represent their source documents in IR tasks such document
   retrieval and text categorization.
   To find the effectiveness of our approach under the proposed evaluation
   scheme, we set out to examine how a system with the diversity
   functionality performs against one without, using the test data known as
   BMIR-J2. The results demonstrate a clear superiority of the
   diversity-based approach to a non-diversity-based approach.
   The paper also addresses the question of how closely the diversity
   approach models human judgments on summarization. We have created a
   relatively large volume of data annotated for relevance to summarization
   by human subjects. We have trained a decision tree-based summarizer
   using the data, and examined how the diversity method compares with the
   supervised method in performance when tested on the data. It was found
   that the diversity approach performs as well as and in some cases
   superior to the supervised method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We will explore various ways to apply query structuring in
   cross-language information retrieval. In the first test, English queries
   were translated into Finnish using an electronic dictionary, and were
   run in a Finnish newspaper database of 55,000 articles. Queries were
   structured by combining the Finnish translation equivalents of the same
   English query key using the syn-operator of the InQuery retrieval
   system. Structured queries performed markedly better than unstructured
   queries. Second, the effects of compound-based structuring using a
   proximity operator for the translation equivalents of query language
   compound components were tested. The method was not useful in syn-based
   queries but resulted in decrease in retrieval effectiveness. Proper,
   names are often non-identical spelling variants in different languages.
   This allows n-gram based translation of names not included in a
   dictionary. In the third test, a query structuring method where the
   Boolean and-operator was used to assign more weight to keys translated
   through n-gram matching gave good results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This investigation examines end-user judgment and evaluation behavior
   during information retrieval (IR) system interactions and extends
   previous research surrounding relevance as a key construct for
   representing the value end-users ascribe to items retrieved from IR
   systems. A self-reporting instrument collected evaluative responses from
   32 end-users related to 1432 retrieved items in relation to five
   characteristics of each item: (1) whether it was on topic, (2) whether
   it was meaningful to the user, (3) whether it was useful in relation to
   the problem at hand, (4) whether the IR system returned the information
   in the right form or format, and (5) whether the information retrieved
   allowed the user to take further action on it. The manner in which these
   characteristics of the retrieved items were considered, differentiated
   and aggregated were examined in relation to the region of relevance
   attributed to those items by the users.
   The nominal nature of the data collected led to non-parametric
   statistical analyses that indicated that end-user evaluation of
   retrieved items to resolve an information problem at hand is most likely
   a multi-stage process. While end-users may differ in their judgments and
   evaluations of retrieved items, they appear to make those decisions, by
   using somewhat consistent heuristic approaches that point to a
   predictive multi-stage model of relevance thresholds that exist on a
   continuum from topic to meaning (pertinence) to functionality (use): (C)

Abstract = {{This research used an information processing approach to analyze the
   pausal behavior of end-users. It is based on viewing the search as a
   series of actions and pauses (rests). The end-users are 41 students and
   3 faculty. After instructions, subjects searched through the semester,
   doing 79 searches. This study identified reasons for pausing, location
   of pauses, hesitation rate and pausal behavior changes over time. This
   study confirms that the searchers pauses less frequently and for shorter
   periods as they progressed through searches with more experience and
   practice, searchers moved more smoothly online, and the hesitation rate
   decreased over time. Over a series of searches or cycles within long
   searches, searchers gradually began to chunk more information between
   pauses. However, the duration of pauses do not vary significantly over
   time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study analyses how students' growing understanding of the topic and
   search experience were related to their choice of search tactics and
   terms while preparing a research proposal for a small empirical study.
   In addition to that, the findings of the study are used to test
   Vakkari's (2001) theory of task-based IR. The research subjects were 22
   students of psychology attending a seminar for preparing the proposal.
   They made a search for their task in PsychINFO database at the beginning
   and end of the seminar. Data were collected in several ways. A pre- and
   post-search interview was conducted in both sessions. The students were
   asked to think aloud in the sessions. This was recorded as were the
   transaction logs. The results show that search experience was slightly
   related to the change of facets. Although the students' vocabulary of
   the topic grew generating an increased use of specific terms between the
   sessions, their use of search tactics and operators remained fairly
   constant. There was no correlation between the terms and tactics used
   and the total number of useful references found. By comparing these
   results with the findings of relevant earlier studies the conclusion was
   drawn that domain knowledge has an impact on searching assuming that
   users have a sufficient command of the system used. This implies that
   the tested theory of task-based IR is valid on condition that the
   searchers are experienced. It is suggested that the theory should be
   enriched by including search experience in its scope. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The growing acceptance of evidence-based decision making in healthcare
   organizations has resulted in recognition of information classification
   and retrieval as a key area of both strategic and operational
   management. In the emerging information-intensive healthcare
   environment, healthcare managers are beginning to understand the
   increased need for formal, continuous information classification and
   coding in health services, creating a need for enhanced information
   retrieval, delivery of services and quality management. Variation in
   classification preferences across practice settings poses healthcare
   quality management problems for evidence-based medicine in such an
   environment. This paper reports results from a major national study into
   the perceived variation reported by health information managers related
   to the relevance-efficiency trade-offs of information classification
   across regions and practice settings. This study provides: (1) a
   benchmark of the degree of such variation, examining how classification
   preferences vary across organization types; regions, and management
   indicators, and (2) the extent to which managers prefer more descriptive
   classification systems, despite nationwide mandates to adopt greater
   non-descriptive categorization of information. Findings suggest that due
   to major regional variation, stringent national information standards
   may be counterproductive for some healthcare practice settings and
   geographic locations. Implications for healthcare information
   classification and retrieval are further examined and discussed. (C)

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{479-502}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Touch screen kiosks have become a popular way of delivering health
   information and much of the associated user activity is automatically
   and routinely recorded in electronic log files. These are a significant
   source of understanding consumer information seeking behaviour. However,
   there has been no evaluation in the literature of the long-term use of
   kiosks. This paper seeks to fill the gap in our knowledge and examines
   the use of a sample of 20 kiosks over three and half years. Identifies
   four patterns of use over time, a declining pattern, a stable;: pattern
   an increasing pattern and a no trend pattern and discusses the
   implications of these patterns. For 75\% of the patterns reported there
   is an initial strong take up in use, often more than a doubling in use;
   in the first four to five months after a kiosk is installed this is
   followed by a just as rapid decline in use. The research found
   differences use between age groups with patients aged 15 and above being
   more likely to be responsible for the initial strong surge in use. The
   research reported here forms part of a Department of Health (DoH) funded
   study which is evaluating the use and impact of more than fifty heath
   kiosks located in all kinds of locations throughout the United Kingdom.

Title = {{Analysis of adaptive cost functions for dynamic update policies for QoS
   routing in hierarchical networks}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{1-26}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{QoS routing for hierarchical networks are adopted for achieving high
   scalability and efficiency, e.g., the Inter/Intra Internet and the ATM
   Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) specification. In
   hierarchical routing, several nodes of lower level are aggregated as a
   logical node of the corresponding next higher level recursively.
   Moreover, in PNNI, each (logical) node bundles its state information in
   the structure of PNNI Topology StateElements (PTSE) and sends to its
   neighbors periodically. That results in hierarchical routing with
   inaccurate information. Since, aggregated routing information is
   exchanged based on a time-based update policy in PNNI. However, the
   dynamic nature of network status makes it very difficult to set an
   appropriate update interval. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two
   cost-based adaptive update policies: Dynamic Cost-based Update policy
   and Dynamic Cost-based Update policy with hysteresis, which update
   routing information only when the change of the cost of a link exceeds a
   threshold. Our numerical results show that the cost-based update
   policies not only reduce connection blocking probability, but also
   decrease the frequency of routing information updates. In this paper, we
   analyze three approaches to define link cost function and examine the
   performance of the cost-based update policies under these link cost
   functions. We find that the proposed cost-based adaptive update policies
   together with the Markov Decision Process-based link cost function yield
   the best performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Title = {{An integrated dynamic memory tracing tool for C++}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{27-49}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic memory management has been a high cost component in many
   software systems. A study has shown that memory intensive C programs can
   consume up to 30\% of the program run time in memory allocation and
   liberation. Especially, in C++ programs, they tend to have object
   creation and deletion prolifically. C++ memory allocation rate can be as
   much as 10 times higher than the comparable applications written in C.
   Despite the importance of dynamic memory management in C++, there exist
   few software tools to study dynamic memory in C++. This paper introduces
   a tracing tool, called mtrace++, to study the dynamic memory allocation
   behavior in C++ programs.
   Mtrace++ is a source code level instrumented tracing tool which produces
   records of allocation and deallocation information. The allocation
   information contains size, type and path. The allocation paths may lead
   to indirect memory allocation. The collected traced data is analyzed by
   stat. Stat produces concise information from the traced data. Mtrace++
   provides extended functionalities which include measuring life-spans and
   detecting memory leaks. With limited overheads, mtrace++ can help
   programmers to solve dynamic memory problems with affordable cost. (C)

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{51-70}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this article, several schemes are proposed for embedding complete
   binary trees (CBT) into meshes. All of the proposed methods outperform
   those in the previous studies. First, a link congestion 1embedding is
   achieved. Its expansion ratio is at the lowest level as we know now.
   Except for this superiority, it also provides another capability for
   fault tolerance to resist abnormal system faults, thus the embedding
   structure can be more guaranteed and the node utilization is raised
   further. Second, a link congestion 1 embedding with no-bending
   constraint is obtained. This scheme provides efficient CBT embedding for
   both the optical mesh and general mesh at the same time while keeping
   those good properties as the previous scheme. The last one is an optimal
   embedding which is applied to a 3D cubic mesh, where the node is almost
   fully utilized and its link congestion is 2. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Title = {{iMail: a WAP mail retrieving system}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{71-91}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes iMail, a WAP mail retrieving system designed for
   wireless handheld devices to access Internet email service. In mobile
   data networks, the communication bandwidth is limited and the wireless
   handsets are constrained by small display, powerless CPU, limited
   memory, and unhandy input/output interface. To support mail retrieving
   in a mobile environment, we implement several features for iMail: mail
   filtering, two-phase fetch and pre-defined list reordering. Based on the
   user's filter options, mail filtering eliminates non-necessary mails
   sent to a wireless handheld device. Two-phase fetch is used to reduce
   transmission overhead of message delivery. We use pre-defined list
   reordering to speed up text typing in the wireless handheld devices. We
   also propose three mail notification mechanisms for iMail. When a new
   mail arrives, the mail notification mechanism informs iMail users
   immediately. Through the descriptions of the iMail features, this paper
   provides design and implementation guidelines for WAP applications. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an algebraic way of sentence valuations in a

   integers with usual addition and multiplication are considered. These
   valuations take into consideration both words and their positions within

Abstract = {{This paper studies the role of lexical contextual relations for the
   problem of unsupervised knowledge discovery in full texts. Narrative
   texts have inherent structure dictated by language usage in generating
   them. We suggest that the relative distance of terms within a text gives
   sufficient information about its structure and its relevant content.
   Furthermore, this structure can be used to discover implicit knowledge
   embedded in the text, therefore serving as a good candidate to represent
   effectively the text content for knowledge elicitation tasks. We
   qualitatively demonstrate that a useful text structure and content can
   be systematically extracted by collocational lexical analysis without
   the need to encode any supplemental sources of knowledge. We present an
   algorithm that systematically extracts the most relevant facts in the
   texts and labels them by their overall theme, dictated by local
   contextual information. It exploits domain independent lexical
   frequencies and mutual information measures to find the relevant
   Contextual units in the texts. We report results from experiments in a
   real-world textual database of psychiatric evaluation reports. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Statistical disclosure control (SDC) and artificial intelligence (AI)
   use similar tools for different purposes. This work describes the common
   elements of both areas to increase their synergy.
   SDC is a discipline that seeks to modify statistical data so that they
   can be published (typically by National Statistical Offices) without
   giving away the identity of any individual behind the data. When dealing
   with individual data (microdata in SDC jargon), both SDC procedures and
   AI knowledge integration procedures use similar principles for different
   purposes (masking data vs. improving its quality). Similarities can also
   be found for methods evaluating re-identification risk in SDC and data
   mining tools for making data consistent.
   This paper explores those methodological connections with the aim of
   stimulating interaction between both fields. In particular, data mining
   turns out to be a common interest of both fields. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{151}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the average query
   complexity of inferring a pair of nested monotone Boolean functions
   defined on \{0,1\}(n) using a pair of oracles. Here, nested refers to
   the case when one of the functions is always greater than or equal to
   the other function. It is shown that the nested case is equivalent to
   inferring the single function case defined on \{0,1\}(n+1) when access
   to the two oracles is unrestricted. Two common examples of restricted
   oracles, namely sequential oracles and a single three-valued oracle, are
   also analyzed. The most efficient known approach to minimizing the
   average query complexity in inferring a single monotone Boolean function
   is based on a query selection criterion. It is shown that the selection
   criterion approach is easily modified for use with restricted oracles.
   Several real world examples illustrate the necessity and sufficiency of
   the nested monotone Boolean function model. Extensive computational
   results indicate that the nestedness assumption reduces the average
   query complexity by a few percent. This is a dramatic improvement
   considering the fact that this complexity is exponential in n. (C) 2003

   supervision}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{151}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new approach to feature selection based on a
   modified fuzzy C-means algorithm with supervision (MFCMS). MFCMS
   completes the unsupervised learning of classical fuzzy C-means with
   labeled patterns. The labeled patterns allow MFCMS to accurately model
   the shape of each cluster and consequently to highlight the features
   which result to be particularly effective to characterize a cluster.
   These features are distinguished by a low variance of their values for
   the patterns with a high membership degree to the cluster. If, with
   respect to these features, the distance between the prototype of the
   cluster and the prototypes of the other clusters is high, then these
   features have the property of discriminating between the cluster and the
   other clusters. To take these two aspects into account, for each cluster
   and each feature, we introduce a purposely defined index: the higher the
   value of the index, the higher the discrimination capability of the
   feature for the cluster. We execute MFCMS on the training set
   considering all patterns as labeled. Then, we retain the features which
   are associated, at least for one cluster, with an index larger than a
   threshold T.
   We applied MFCMS to several real-world pattern classification
   benchmarks. We used the well-known k-nearest neighbors as learning
   algorithm. We show that feature selection performed by MFCMS achieved an
   improvement in generalization on all data sets. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model for the uncertain Chen's chaotic system

   as a set of uncertain linear systems and a controller design algorithm
   is proposed. Specifically, a switching static output-feedback

Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper, we investigate explicit structure of
   the typical Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy PI and PD controllers. By typical,
   we mean the use of at least three trapezoidal or triangular input fuzzy
   sets for each input variable, fuzzy rules with linear consequent, Zadeh
   fuzzy logic AND operator and the centroid defuzzifier. This
   configuration covers many TS fuzzy controllers in the literature. We
   mathematically prove these fuzzy controllers to be nonlinear PI (or PD)
   controllers with proportional-gain and integral-gain (or
   derivative-gain) changing with output of the controlled system. We
   reveal these fuzzy controllers to be inherently nonlinear gain
   scheduling PI (or PD) controllers with different variable gains in
   different regions of input space. The gains constantly change even in
   the same region, and switch continuously and smoothly between adjacent
   regions. The explicit structural expressions of the fuzzy controllers
   are derived and their characteristics, including the bounds and
   geometrical shape of the gain variation, are studied. In the second part
   of the paper, we apply the Small Gain Theorem to the derived structures
   of the fuzzy controllers and establish a sufficient global BIBO
   stability criterion for nonlinear systems controlled by the fuzzy
   controllers. Local stability is also examined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{301-326}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{There are two classical ways of viewing a fuzzy set in terms of a
   combination of crisp sets; either as a weighted max-aggregation of its
   level-cuts, or as a convex combination of the latter. These views are
   applied to the particular case of fuzzy relations which are induced by
   fuzzy rules, where the rules are modeled by implication connectives
   (defined on a finite subset of the unit interval). The paper studies
   more closely the representation of such fuzzy rules in terms of a convex
   combination of gradual rules, a special type of implication-based fuzzy
   rule inducing a crisp relation. This representation, which might be
   interpreted in a probabilistic way, is shown to be unique on the
   assumption that the implication operator used for modeling the fuzzy
   rule does not satisfy a special kind of strict monotonicity condition.
   In this case, the crisp relations induced by the involved gradual rules
   correspond to level-cuts of the fuzzy relation associated with the fuzzy
   rule. However, other representations might exist if the aforementioned
   property is not satisfied. Under a slightly stronger (strict)
   monotonicity condition, the existence of further (non-consonant)
   representations is even guaranteed. Then, the crisp relations induced by
   gradual rules do not necessarily correspond to level-cuts of the
   underlying fuzzy relation. In this sense, the decomposition of a fuzzy
   rule into a class of crisp implication-based rules is more general than
   the classical decomposition of fuzzy sets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Human exploration and development of space will involve opening the
   space frontier by exploring, using and enabling the development of space
   through information technology, while expanding the human experience
   into the far reaches of space. At that point in time we assert that the
   current primitive World Wide Web (Web) will be replaced and dramatically
   expanded into an Interstellar Space Wide Web (SWW). The current
   state-of-the-art low-orbits communications satellites constellations
   will be dramatically expanded to higher orbits and to orbits supporting
   work on other remote human colonies. This will be necessary in order to
   furnish in a human-friendly way the necessary software and information
   that will be needed in support of Interstellar Space Wide Information
   Technologies. Many of the problems encountered in conceiving of,
   modeling, designing and deploying such a facility will be different from
   those problems encountered in today's Web. Future research and
   development work will be to identify some of these problems and to
   conceptually model a few of their solutions. In this work we describe
   research into the development of scalable tools and techniques that
   reduce the effort associated with component integration, both with
   respect to network environments and with respect to other components
   within the application. Our approach is also targeted at increasing the
   reusability of software components and software architectures. Our
   research is to investigate current problems in leveraging adapters as a
   means to configure of large-scale Next Generation distributed systems
   software from reusable architectures and components. Our approach to
   solving this problem is through the development of a novel configuration
   model and network-aware runtime environment called SWWACXML, for Space
   Wide Web Adapter Configuration eXtensible Markup Language. SWWACXML
   provides support for cross-layer architectural configuration at both the
   application level and the level of individual network connections. The
   language associated with this environment captures component interaction
   properties and network level quality-of-service (QoS) constraints.
   Adapters will be generated automatically from SWWACXML specifications.
   These adapters are part of the SWWACXML runtime system. The runtime
   system includes facilities for automatic configuration and runtime
   reconfiguration, as well as efficient management of network connections
   and QoS options. This facilitates reuse because components are not tied
   to interactions or environments. Another aspect of this work will focus
   on development and experimentation with a novel Web-based interaction
   paradigm that allows client adapters to tailor themselves to servers at
   runtime. One of the strengths of our approach is that clients do not
   have to be tied to specific servers at implementation time. Rather, a
   client's adapter loads an SWWACXML configuration page from the server.
   The SWWACXML configuration page defines the appropriate interaction,
   including management of heterogeneous network QoS options. We believe
   our approach is amenable to facilitate a style of dynamic
   reconfiguration, where clients can at runtime change server,
   communication or interaction protocol. Future researchers and developers
   will design and implement the SWWACXML system in a distributed test-bed.
   They will develop performance analysis techniques to judge the success
   and efficiency of our approach. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of multi-agent systems (MAS), there is a pressing
   need to communicate between different MAS. Various MAS communication
   standards have been proposed. However, MAS is usually designed to meet
   special need, thus making it difficult to follow a standard. This paper
   presents a tool called AgentGateway trying to solve this problem using a
   simple, effective approach. The tool translates messages from one MAS to
   intermediate XML-based messages, which then are translated to messages
   for another MAS. AgentGateway is scalable, meaning that new MAS can
   easily join it. Furthermore, it provides transparent and reliable
   communication. A prototype is developed that shows communication between
   two MAS, namely, Java Agent Template Lite (JATLite) and OAA, can be done
   using this approach. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Page rank-based prefetching technique for accesses
   to Web page clusters. The approach uses the link structure of a
   requested page to determine the,'most important{''} linked pages and to
   identify the page(s) to be prefetched. The underlying premise of our
   approach is that in the case of cluster accesses, the next pages
   requested by users of the Web server are typically based on the current
   and previous pages requested. Furthermore, if the requested pages have a
   lot of links to some ``important{''} page, that page has a higher
   probability of being the next one requested. An experimental evaluation
   of the prefetching mechanism is presented using real server logs. The
   results show that the Page rank-based scheme does better than random
   prefetching for clustered accesses, with hit rates of 90\% in some
   cases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing heterogeneity, complexity, and distributed nature of
   deployment architectures only serve to compound the problems faced by
   software solutions. With the advent of the Internet and web
   technologies, system designers have had to reevaluate the applicability
   of eta-tier architectures, and assess which technologies are appropriate
   at each tier. In this paper we evaluate the design issues of eta-tier
   architecture. We debate whether it is good to move code or data to
   communicate messages between applications. Based on the latest
   technology of J2EE and NET framework, we recommend a data centric design
   of eta-tier architecture. Based on our experience we also suggest a
   modified interactive software process model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper examines the current trends in the e-commerce revolution that
   has set in motion in the Malaysian banking sector and reports on an
   empirical research that was carried out in Malaysia to study the
   customers' preference for electronic banking and the factors, which they
   considered influenced the adoption of electronic banking. Results based
   on the analysis of data relating to 300 respondents indicate that while
   there is no significant differences between the age and educational
   qualifications of the electronic and conventional banking users, some
   differences exists on other demographic variables. Analysis further
   reveals that accessibility of Internet, a wareness of e-banking, and
   customers' reluctance to change are the factors that significantly
   affected the usage of e-banking in Malaysia. The paper discusses on the
   implications of these. Limitations of the study are highlighted and
   further research directions are suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Connectionist views for adaptive clustering in information retrieval
   (IR) have proved to be viable approaches, and have yielded a number of
   models and techniques. However there has never been any exhaustive and
   methodical-i.e., theoretical, formal, practical, simulation- and
   user-based-evaluation of such a retrieval method and system. The aim of
   the paper is therefore just this. It suggests a connectionist clustering
   technique and activation spreading-based IR model using the interaction
   information retrieval (I(2)R) method. Theoretical as well as simulation
   results as regards computational complexity of this method are presented
   and discussed. Evaluations of relevance effectiveness are also given
   using standard test collections. Two applications were designed,
   developed and implemented based on this method. Their relevance
   effectiveness was evaluated in vivo in experiments carried out with
   human subjects. The results obtained show that I(2)R based on a
   connectionist approach proves useful when emphasis is on high precision.

Abstract = {{A fuzzy multiset model for information clustering is proposed with
   application to information retrieval on the World Wide Web. Noting that
   a search engine retrieves multiple occurrences of the same subjects with
   possibly different degrees of relevance, we observe that fuzzy multisets
   provide an appropriate model of information retrieval on the WWW.
   Information clustering which means both term clustering and document
   clustering is considered. Three methods of the hard c-means, fuzzy
   c-means, and an agglomerative method using cluster centers are proposed.
   Two distances between fuzzy multisets and algorithms for calculating
   cluster centers are defined. Theoretical properties concerning the
   clustering algorithms are studied. Illustrative examples are given to
   show how the algorithms work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that significant improvement in information
   retrieval performance can be achieved by combining multiple
   representations of an information need. The paper presents a genetic
   approach that combines the results from multiple query evaluations. The
   genetic algorithm aims to optimise the overall relevance estimate by
   exploring different directions of the document space. We investigate
   ways to improve the effectiveness of the genetic exploration by
   combining appropriate techniques and heuristics known in genetic theory
   or in the IR field. Indeed, the approach uses a niching technique to
   solve the relevance multimodality problem, a relevance feedback
   technique to perform genetic transformations on query formulations and
   evolution heuristics in order to improve the convergence conditions of
   the genetic process. The effectiveness of the global approach is
   demonstrated by comparing the retrieval results obtained by both genetic
   multiple query evaluation and classical single query evaluation
   performed on a subset of TREC-4 using the Mercure IRS. Moreover,
   experimental results show the positive effect of the various techniques
   integrated to our genetic algorithm model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Recommender systems evaluate and filter the great amount of information
   available on the Web to assist people in their search processes. A fuzzy
   evaluation method of Standard Generalized Markup Language documents
   based on computing with words is presented. Given a document type
   definition (DTD), we consider that its elements are not equally
   informative. This is indicated in the DTD by defining linguistic
   importance attributes to the more meaningful elements of DTD chosen.
   Then, the evaluation method generates linguistic recommendations from
   linguistic evaluation judgements provided by different recommenders on
   meaningful elements of DTD. To do so, the evaluation method uses two
   quantifier guided linguistic aggregation operators, the linguistic
   weighted averaging operator and the linguistic ordered weighted
   averaging operator, which allow us to obtain recommendations taking into
   account the fuzzy majority of the recommenders' judgements. Using the
   fuzzy linguistic modeling the user-system interaction is facilitated and
   the assistance of system is improved. The method can be easily extended
   on the Web to evaluate HyperText Markup Language and eXtensible Markup
   Language documents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we combine computer vision and data mining techniques to
   model high-level concepts for image retrieval, on the basis of basic
   perceptual features of the human visual system. High-level concepts
   related to these features are learned and represented by means of a set
   of fuzzy association rules. The concepts so acquired can be used for
   image retrieval with the advantage that it is not needed to provide an
   image as a query. Instead, a query is formulated by using the labels
   that identify the learned concepts as search terms, and the retrieval
   process calculates the relevance of an image to the query by an
   inference mechanism. An additional feature of our methodology is that it
   can capture user's subjectivity. For that purpose, fuzzy sets theory is
   employed to measure user's assessments about the fulfillment of a
   concept by an image. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The collection fusion problem of image databases is concerned with
   retrieving relevant images by content based retrieval from image
   databases distributed on the Web. While there have been many studies
   about database selection and collection fusion for text databases,
   little research has been attempted for the case of image databases.
   Image databases on the Web have heterogeneous characteristics since they
   use different similarity measures and queries are processed depending on
   their own policies. Our previous study {[}Inf. Process. Lett. 75 (1-2)
   (2000) 35] provided three algorithms for this problem. In this paper,
   the metaserver selects image databases supporting similarity measures
   that are correlated with a global similarity measure, and then submits a
   query to them. And, we propose a new algorithm for this metaserver,
   which exploits a probabilistic technique using Bayesian estimation for a
   linear regression model. It outperforms the previous approach for
   diverse sizes of result sets for a query, and its improvement in
   effectiveness becomes especially large with small sizes of result sets.
   We also provide a virtual optimal algorithm to which our algorithm is
   compared. With extensive experiments we show the superiority of the
   Bayesian method over the others. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper is situated in the area of flexible queries addressed to
   regular relational databases. Some works have been carried out in the
   past years in order to design languages allowing the expression of
   queries involving preferences through the use of fuzzy predicates. In
   the relational setting, extensions of the relational algebra as well as
   of SQL-like languages have been proposed and a wide range of fuzzy
   queries has been made available. However, the use of conditions
   involving an aggregate function applying to a fuzzy set is not yet
   possible except for the cardinality (count) in the context of the
   so-called fuzzy quantified statements. The objective of this paper is to
   investigate how (and under which conditions) other aggregate functions
   (such as the maximum...) could be applied to fuzzy sets in a flexible
   query. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Web and multimedia data are becoming very important. A fundamental
   characteristic of these data is imprecision. Query languages for Web and
   multimedia data must express imprecision in features matching,
   similarity queries and user preferences. In addition specific operators
   need to be introduced to organize the answers in a user friendly style.
   The aim of this work is to provide a formal framework in which to
   formulate very powerful queries and presentations of the answers. To
   this end, a fuzzy based algebra is introduced. The fuzzy algebra extends
   the classical relational algebra over fuzzy relations with new
   operators. Both algebras allow user preferences in the form of weights
   to be attached to predicates and operators. The effect of this weights
   is to alter the classic behavior of query expressions to better suite
   user requirements. In addition, optimization issues are presented in the
   form of algorithms for the efficient evaluation of similarity based
   queries, containing new algebraic operators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This contribution aims to shortly describe a data structure for creating
   and managing archives of thematic maps derived by classifying remotely
   sensed images by soft techniques (soft maps). Unlike traditional models
   for managing spatial data, the main key feature for query formulation is
   time, thus improving the investigation on changes occurred in time
   ranges. The data structure originally extends time-based models to soft
   maps, thus promoting a retrieval by changes approach also in the
   monitoring of phenomena for which hard classifications are not
   sufficiently accurate nor complete.
   The data structure has been implemented in a system, which is also
   described, available today in a Windows version. It has been applied to
   the monitoring of variations of Alpine glaciers. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   account for the fast changes in the phonemes, the features were
   calculated for different phoneme durations and the performance was

Abstract = {{A methodology for the encoding of the chromosome of a genetic algorithm
   (GA) is described in the paper. The encoding procedure is applied to the
   problem of automatically generating fuzzy rule-based models from data.
   Models generated by this approach have much of the flexibility of
   black-box methods, such as neural networks. In addition, they implicitly
   express information about the process being modelled through the
   linguistic terms associated with the rules. They can be applied to
   problems that are too complex to model in a first principles sense and
   can reduce the computational overhead when compared to established first
   principles based models. The encoding mechanism allows the rule base
   structure and parameters of the fuzzy model to be estimated
   simultaneously from data. The principle advantage is the preservation of
   the linguistic concept without the need to consider the entire rule
   base. The GA searches for the optimum solution given a comparatively
   small number of rules compared to all possible. This minimises the
   computational demand of the model generation and allows problems with
   realistic dimensions to be considered. A further feature is that the
   rules are extracted from the data without the need to establish any
   information about the model structure a priori. The implementation of
   the algorithm is described and the approach is applied to the modelling
   of components of heating ventilating and air-conditioning systems. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a new application domain for intelligent
   autonomous systems-intelligent buildings (IB). In doing so we present a
   novel approach to the implementation of IB agents based on a
   hierarchical fuzzy genetic multi-embedded-agent architecture comprising
   a low-level behaviour based reactive layer whose outputs are
   co-ordinated in a fuzzy way according to deliberative plans. The fuzzy
   rules related to the room resident comfort are learnt and adapted online
   using our patented fuzzy-genetic techniques (British patent 99-10539.7).
   The learnt rule base is updated and adapted via an iterative
   machine-user dialogue. This learning starts from the best stored rule
   set in the agent memory (Experience Bank) thereby decreasing the
   learning time and creating an intelligent agent with memory. We discuss
   the role of learning in building control systems, and we explain the
   importance of acquiring information from sensors, rather than relying on
   pre-programmed models, to determine user needs. We describe how our
   architecture, consisting of distributed embedded agents, utilises
   sensory information to learn to perform tasks related to user comfort,
   energy conservation, and safety. We show how these agents, employing a
   behaviour-based approach derived from robotics research, are able to
   continuously learn and adapt to individuals within a building, whilst
   always providing a fast, safe response to any situation. In addition we
   show that our system learns similar rules to other offline supervised
   methods but that our system has the additional capability to rapidly
   learn and optimise the learnt rule base. Applications of this system
   include personal support (e.g. increasing independence and quality of
   life for older people), energy efficiency in commercial buildings or
   living-area control systems for space vehicles and planetary habitation
   modules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chaos offers several advantages to the Engineer over other non-chaotic
   dynamics. One is that chaotic systems are often significantly easier to
   control than other linear or non-linear systems, requiring only small,
   appropriately timed perturbations to constrain them within specific
   unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). Another is that chaotic attractors
   contain an infinite number of these UPOs. If individual UPOs can be made
   to represent specific internal states of a system, then a chaotic
   attractor can be turned into an infinite state machine. In this paper we
   investigate this possibility with respect to chaotic neural networks. We
   present a method by which a network can self-select UPOs in response to
   specific input values. These UPOs correspond to network recognition
   states for these input values. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The automatic design of fuzzy rule-based classification systems based on
   labeled data is considered. It is recognized that both classification
   performance and interpretability are of major importance and effort is
   made to keep the resulting rule bases small and comprehensible. For this

   proposed. The initial model is derived from the data and subsequently,
   feature selection and rule-base simplification are applied to reduce the
   model, while a genetic algorithm is used for parameter optimization. An
   application to the Wine data classification problem is shown. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper addresses parallel execution of chain code generation on a
   linear array architecture. The contours in the proposed algorithm are
   viewed as a set of edges (or contour segments) that can be traced by a
   top-down contour tracing method to generate the chain codes for the
   outer and inner object contours. A parallel algorithm that contains the
   chain code generating rules and operations needed is also described, and
   the algorithm is mapped onto a one-dimensional systolic array containing
   {[}(1)/(2)(N + 1)] processing elements (PEs) to devise this
   architecture. The architecture extracts the contours of objects and
   quickly generates the corresponding chain codes after the image data in
   all rows are inputted in a linear fashion. The total processing time for
   generating the chain codes in an N x N image is O(3N). By doing so, the
   real-time requirement is fulfilled and its execution time is independent
   of the image content. In addition, a partition method is developed to
   process an image when the parallel architecture has a fixed number of
   PEs; say two or more. The total execution time for an N x N image by
   employing a fixed number of PEs is N(N + 1)/M + 2(M - 1), when M is the
   fixed number of PEs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Generating the local memory access sequences. is an integral part of
   compiling a,data-parallel program into an SPMD code. Most previous
   research into local memory access sequences have focused on
   one-dimensional arrays distributed with CYCLIC(k) distribution. The
   local memory access sequences for multidimensional arrays with
   independent subscripts are produced by repeatedly applying the method
   for one-dimensional arrays. However, the task becomes highly complex
   when subscripts are coupled such that the subscripts in different
   dimensions depend on the same loop induction variables. This paper
   presents an efficient approach to computing the iterations executed on
   each processor by exploiting repetitive patterns in memory accesses.
   Smaller iteration tables than those of Ramanujam. {[}Code generation,
   for complex subscripts in data-parallel programs, in: Z. Li et al.

   implemented on an IBM SP2. Experimental results demonstrate the

Abstract = {{A new approach for supporting reactive cap-ability is described in the
   context of an advanced object-oriented database system called ADOME-II.
   Besides having a rich set of pre-defined composite event expressions and

   to reactive processing so as to be able to gracefully accommodate.
   dynamic applications' requirements. In this approach, production rules
   combined with methods are used, as a unifying mechanism, to. process
   rules, to enable incremental detection of composite events, and to allow
   new composite event expressions to be introduced into the system
   declaratively. This allows the definition of new production rules each
   time an extension of the model takes place. Methods of supporting new
   composite event expressions are described, and comparisons with other
   relevant approaches are also conducted. A prototype of ADOME-II has been
   constructed, which has as its implementation base an ordinary (passive)
   OODBMS and a production rule base system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Local similarity pattern (LSP) is proposed as a new method for computing
   image similarity. Similarity of a pair of images is expressed in terms
   of similarities of the corresponding image regions, obtained by the
   uniform partitioning of the image area. Different from the existing
   methods, each region-wise similarity is computed using a different
   combination of image features (color, shape, and texture). In addition,
   a method for optimizing the LSP-based similarity computation, based on
   genetic algorithm, is proposed, and incorporated in the relevance
   feedback mechanism,. allowing the user to automatically specify
   LSP-based queries. LSP is evaluated on five test databases totalling
   around 2500 images of various sorts. Compared with both the conventional
   and the relevance feedback methods for computing image similarity, LSP
   brings in average over 11\% increase in the retrieval precision. Results
   suggest that the proposed LSP method, allowing comparison of different
   image regions using different similarity criteria, is more suited for
   modeling the human perception of image similarity than the existing
   methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic categorization is a viable method to deal with the scaling
   problem on the World Wide Web. For Web site classification, this paper
   proposes the use of Web pages linked with the home page in a different
   manner from the sole use of home pages in previous research. To
   implement our proposed method, we derive a scheme for Web site
   classification based on the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach: It
   consists of three phases: Web page selection (connectivity analysis),
   Web page classification, and Web site classification. Given a Web site,
   the Web page selection chooses several representative Web pages using
   connectivity analysis. The k-NN classifier next classifies each of the
   selected Web pages. Finally, the classified Web pages are extended to a
   classification of the entire Web site. To improve performance, we
   supplement the k-NN approach with a feature selection method and a term
   weighting scheme using markup tags, and also reform its
   document-document similarity measure. In our experiments on a Korean
   commercial Web directory, the proposed system, using both a home page
   and its linked pages, improved the performance of micro-averaging
   breakeven point by 30.02\%, compared with an ordinary classification
   which uses a home page only. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Reuse of existing software for new purposes is a key aspect of efficient
   software engineering. But finding opportunities for reuse can be
   difficult when building a large software system with pieces of a large
   previous system. Our approach is to match formal written
   ``requirements{''} used to define the new software against requirements
   used to define the old software; requirement pairs with words in common
   suggest software-reuse opportunities. We explored two matching
   methodologies that use information-retrieval techniques. We tested our
   methods by comparing two US military systems, the Aviation Mission
   Planning System and the Joint Mission Planning System. Our second tool
   reduced the time to find 50\% of the matching requirements by 99.4\%
   compared to manual matching. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Search engines play an essential role in the usability of Internet-based
   information systems and without them the Web would be much less
   accessible, and at the very least would develop at a much slower rate.
   Given that non-English users now tend to make up the majority in this
   environment, our main objective is to analyze and evaluate the retrieval
   effectiveness of various indexing and search strategies based on
   test-collections written in four different languages: English, French,
   German, and Italian. Our second objective is to describe and evaluate
   various approaches that might be implemented in order to effectively
   access document collections written in another language. As a third
   objective, we will explore the underlying problems involved in searching
   document collections written in the four different languages, and we
   will suggest and evaluate different database merging strategies capable
   of providing the user with a single unique result list. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The inverted file is the most popular indexing mechanism for document
   search in an information retrieval system. Compressing an inverted file
   can greatly improve document search rate. Traditionally, the d-gap
   technique is used in the inverted file compression by replacing document
   identifiers with usually much smaller gap values. However, fluctuating
   gap values cannot be efficiently compressed by some well-known
   prefix-free codes. To smoothen and reduce the gap values, we propose a
   document-identifier reassignment algorithm. This reassignment is based
   on a similarity factor between documents. We generate a reassignment
   order for all documents according to the similarity to reassign closer
   identifiers to the documents having closer relationships. Simulation
   results show that the average gap values of sample inverted files can be
   reduced by 30\%, and the compression rate of d-gapped inverted file with
   prefix-free codes can be improved by 15\%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Decision support for the academic library acquisition budget allocation
   via circulation database mining}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{133-147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many approaches to decision support for the academic library acquisition
   budget allocation have been proposed to diversely reflect the management
   requirements. Different from these methods that focus mainly on either
   statistical analysis or goal programming, this paper introduces a model
   (ABAMDM, acquisition budget allocation model via data mining) that
   addresses the use of descriptive knowledge discovered in the historical
   circulation data explicitly to support allocating library acquisition
   budget. The major concern in this study is that the budget allocation
   should be able to reflect a requirement that the more a department makes
   use of its acquired materials in the present academic year, the more it
   can get budget for the coming year. The primary output of the ABAMDM
   used to derive weights of acquisition budget allocation contains two
   parts. One is the descriptive knowledge via utilization concentration
   and the other is the suitability via utilization connection for
   departments concerned. An application to the library of Kun Shan
   University of Technology was described to demonstrate the introduced
   ABAMDM in practice. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Passive Optical Network (PON)-based Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) is a
   promising solution that can break through the economic barrier of
   traditional point-to-point solutions. Once fibers are deployed with
   PON-based FTTH solutions, it becomes critical how to migrate to
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)-PON because Time Division
   Multiplexing (TDM) used in current PON solutions cannot exploit the huge
   bandwidth of the optical fibers and therefore will not be able to meet
   ever-increasing demands for higher bandwidth by future network
   applications. In this paper we review and compare the current PON-based
   FTTH solutions, ATM-PON (APON) and Ethernet PON (EPON), and provide a
   possible evolution scenario to future WDMPON. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Organic/inorganic matrix nanocomposites have been created using an acid
   catalyzed, tetraethyl orthosilicate-based sol-gel technique with
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). By utilizing nanotubes
   functionalized with the dendron methyl 3,5-di(methyltrigycoloxy)benzylic
   alcohol (I-PEG), ultrasonic blending in the sol phase prior to gelation
   yields excellent dispersion characteristics of the nanotube phase. The
   glasses were densified by heating to 600 degreesC yielding 80\% of
   theoretical density with little change in the optical appearance or
   behavior. These materials exhibited intrinsic Rayleigh scattering,
   suggesting near ideal dispersion. Nonlinear optical transmission was
   observed for 1064 and 532 nm light suggesting that the matrix has a
   strong broad band coupling to the optical field. Such composites allow
   for a host of applications based on the novel confinement properties of
   carbon nanotubes in a robust inorganic host. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Optical crosstalk, a problem commonly found in Dilated Optical
   Multistage Interconnection Networks (DOMINs), is the outcome of
   undesirable coupling within a 2 x 2 directional coupler. As widely
   recognized, a switch is faulty if it causes crosstalk in excess a given
   threshold, the value of which can be determined according to certain
   criteria. Diagnosing faulty switches, which includes detection and
   location procedures, has become an important issue for DOMINs. The fault
   cluster (or test set) is an independent set of tests for diagnosing
   faulty switches. The test patterns (or disjoint faults) in each fault
   cluster can be applied in parallel during diagnosis. The fault-table
   method is a classical analytic and deterministic minimization method
   used in the circuit testing of VLSI. The method is especially efficient
   when tackling complicated circuits, and can be solved efficiently by
   modern computer technology. An algorithm that uses the tabulation method
   is developed to obtain the optimal fault cluster(s) for both detection
   and location tests. The paths of the injected signal, output signal and
   faulty signal throughout the network are collected to determine the
   conflict table. Then, the conflict table is minimized to yield the fault
   clusters. The fault clusters are then stored in the management system.
   The results can help us to diagnose faulty switches in parallel to
   accelerate the diagnosis. The tabulation methodology follows the same
   diagnostic procedure for the various infrastructures and is independent
   of the size of the DOMINs.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of multicast routing and wavelength
   assignment under the multi-drop path model (MRWA-MP). In a multi-drop
   path model, multiple paths are employed to establish a multicast session
   and each path can drop signals at no more than a predefined number of
   destination nodes. Given a network topology and a multicast session, the
   MRWA-MP problem is to minimize the number of wavelengths used to
   establish the multicast session and, as an auxiliary objective, minimize
   the number of fibers used. We derive bounds for both objectives. The
   lower bound on the number of wavelengths derived is tighter and thus
   more accurate than that in recent papers. To gain an insight into the
   complexity of the MRWA-MP problem, we formulate it as a mixed integer
   linear programming (MILP) problem and solve it using CPLEX integer
   optimizer. Our experience indicates that this problem can easily
   overwhelm even a state-of-the-art computing facility. To solve the
   MRWA-MP problem efficiently, we develop a heuristic, MFBH, based on the
   Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm. Through experiments, we show that
   the MFBH heuristic achieves the lower bound on the number of wavelengths
   in almost all instances of the real-life and randomly generated networks
   that we tested. Furthermore, MFBH tends to use fewer fibers when the
   maximum number of drops allowed on a single path decreases, the number
   of destination nodes in a multicast session increases, or the
   connectivity of the network decreases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the performance of various schemes for
   restoration of lightpaths in an optical mesh network. We consider
   schemes in which backup paths for links or paths are pro-computed, but
   wavelength assignment is either pro-computed (static) or done
   dynamically upon failure (dynamic). In static restoration we compare the
   performance of link and path restoration in terms of capacity
   requirement and restoration time. For the dynamic restoration, we
   consider several dynamic wavelength reservation schemes such as backward
   and forward reservation with different portion of wavelength to be
   reserved in both directions. Their performance is evaluated in terms of
   restoration speed and restorability. Simulation results indicate that
   path protection requires less capacity than link protection for 100\%
   restorability, and dynamic restoration with backward wavelength
   reservation shows better restorability than static restoration schemes,
   when the extra capacity is relatively small. Forward wavelength
   reservation shows faster restoration speed with lower restorability than
   the backward wavelength reservation. In general, the optimal restoration
   scheme depends on extra capacity available and restoration time limit.

Abstract = {{Traditional survivable network design assumes that at any time at most a
   single link or node fails. In optical networks, a single point of
   failure may lead to the failure of multiple links. In this paper, we
   consider the design of an optical network that can survive the failures
   of any two neighboring links. We present a loopback recovery method that
   requires the computation of backup paths for each link. An optimal
   algorithm for computing the backup paths is presented. Numerical results
   comparing the performance of our algorithm with other loopback
   approaches indicate that a slight increase in capacity can achieve 100\%

Abstract = {{A LR parsing table is generally made use of the parsing process based on
   the context free grammar for natural languages. Besides the parsing
   process, it can be used as the index of approximate pattern matching and
   error correction, because it has the characteristic to be able to
   predict the next character in the sentence. As for the issue of the
   traditional LR parsing table, however we can mention if the number of
   sequences to be processed becomes large, many reduce actions will be
   created in the parsing table, as a result, it takes a great deal of time
   to parse the sentence. In this paper, we propose the method to construct
   a new LR parsing table without reduce actions from the generalized
   context free grammar. This new parsing table denotes the states to be
   transited after accepting each symbol. Moreover, we applied this new
   parsing table to detect and correct erroneous sentences which include
   the syntax errors, unknown words and misspelling. By using this table,
   the symbol which is allocated just after the error position can be
   utilized for selecting correction symbols, as a result, the number of
   candidates produced on the correction process is reduced, and fast
   system can be realized. The experiment results, using 1050 sentences
   including error characters, show that this method can correct error
   points 69 times faster than the traditional method, also keep the almost
   same correction accuracy as the traditional method. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To solve the long training time in Waibel's time-delay neural networks
   (TDNNs) for phoneme recognition, several improved fast learning methods
   are put forward: (1) by a combination between the unsupervised Oja's
   rule learning method with the similar error backpropagation (BP)
   algorithm for initial weights training; (2) by improving of the error
   energy function with weights update according to the output error size;
   (3) by changing of BP error from along layers to frames and using the
   averaged overlapping part of frame-shift delta values in the weights of
   the bottom layer; (4) by training of the data from a small to large
   number of samples gradually; and (5) by using the optimal modular neural
   networks (OMNNs) with tree structure for multiple phonemes. Our
   experimental results indicate that the convergence speed is accelerated
   with orders of magnitude and in most cases the error function descends
   monotonically while the network complexity increases less and the
   recognition rates are almost the same among the different comparative

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{41-53}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper shows that each rough set can be evaluated from two different
   aspects which may be considered as two facets of rough sets. One refers
   to the conceptual meaning of each rough set, e.g., we say that the
   concept of lion is included in the concept of animal and the concept of
   animal has a higher order of inclusion than the concept of lion. The
   second one refers to the amount of knowledge that each rough set
   exhibits, e.g., a zoologist may consider a more informative rough set
   for the concept of lion (he considers more kinds of lions in his set)
   than a rough set which proposed by a non-specialist person. So, the
   first facet views the theory of rough set as an extension of the
   classical set theory in terms of the three-valued logic which is a
   proper tool of reasoning and decision making based on a solitary source
   of information. The second facet concerns the ability of rough set
   theory to knowledge manipulation and reduction among several information
   sources such that we do not care the soundness or falsity of the
   available information. We show that the second facet is the salient
   characteristic of rough sets which has the capability of being extended
   more in new application areas. As a result, we present a new extension
   of rough sets called rough communication as a proper tool of dealing
   with several information sources. At the end, we refer to some
   interesting mathematical symmetries between two facets which may be used
   to propose new extensions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work a new method of feature extraction for an interactive and
   adaptive recognizer for on-line handwritten alphanumeric characters has
   been proposed. The system is suitable for use in conjunction with
   magnetic pen based devices for inputting data to a data processing
   system or a computer terminal. The features are extracted from
   dynamically changing locations of the writing device. The new method of
   feature extraction is simple, computationally light and fast enough for
   adaptive on-line use. Extracted features are-robust with respect to all
   possible distortions like shape, size, and orientation. For simulation
   experiment, numerals 0-9 are used. A single hidden layer feed forward
   neural network trained by Quickprop algorithm, a variation of error back
   propagation is used for recognition. Very high recognition rates, even
   for highly distorted samples have been achieved confirming high
   generalization capability of the extracted feature set., (C) 2002

Abstract = {{There have been a number of previous successful efforts that show how
   fuzzy logic concepts have homomorphic-like stochastic correspondences,
   utilizing one-point coverages of appropriately constructed random sets.
   Independent of this and fuzzy logic considerations in general, boolean
   relational event algebra (BREA) has been introduced within a stochastic
   setting for representing prescribed compositional functions of event
   probabilities by single compounded event probabilities. In the special
   case of the functions being restricted to division corresponding to
   pairs of nested sets, BREA reduced to boolean conditional event algebra
   (BCEA). BCEA has been successfully applied to issues involving
   comparing, contrasting and combining rules of inference, especially for
   those having differing antecedents. In this paper we show how, in a new
   way, not only BCEA, but also more generally, RCEA, can be applied to
   provide homomorphic-like connections between fuzzy logic quantifiers and
   classical logic relations applied to random sets. This also leads to an
   improved consistency criterion for these connections. Finally, when the
   above is specialized to BCEA, a novel extension of crisp boolean
   conditional events is obtained, compatible with the above improved
   consistency criterion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{An implementation of a neurally-inspired system comprised of multiple

   the environment and the behavior of other agents. The system as a whole
   spatiotemporally reconfigures itself to perform coordinated behaviors
   not obtainable with single agents. Transient clustering of agents into
   functional subsystems to perform specific tasks generates a ``system of

   platform show that (a) the formation and dissolution of functional
   subsystems is a local phenomenon without the need for global control and

Abstract = {{Self-adaptive software is one of the key discoveries in the field of
   evolutionary computation, originally invented in the framework of
   so-called Evolution Strategies in Germany. Self-adaptivity enables the
   algorithm to dynamically adapt to the problem characteristics and even
   to cope with changing environmental conditions - as they occur in
   unforeseeable ways in many real-world business applications.
   In evolution strategies, self-adaptability is generated by means of an
   evolutionary search process that operates on the solutions generated by
   the method as well as on the evolution strategy's parameters, i.e., the
   algorithm itself. By focusing on a basic algorithmic variant of
   evolution strategies, the fundamental idea of self-adaptation is
   outlined in this paper.
   Applications of evolution strategies for NuTech's clients include the
   whole range of business tasks, including R\&D, technical design,
   control, production, quality control, logistics, and management decision
   support. While such examples can of course not be disclosed, we
   illustrate the capabilities of evolution strategies by giving some
   simpler application examples to problems occurring in traffic control

Abstract = {{Digital geometry is the study of geometrical properties of subsets of
   digital images. If the digitization is sufficiently fine-grained, such
   properties can be regarded as approximations to the corresponding
   properties of the ``real{''} sets that gave rise, by digitization, to
   the digital sets; but it is also important to define how the properties
   can be computed for the digital sets themselves. Questions of particular
   interest include how images and image subsets are digitized; how
   geometric properties are defined for digitized sets; the computational
   complexity of computing them-in particular, whether they can be computed
   using simple (e.g., local) operations; characterizing image operations
   that preserve them; and characterizing digital objects that could be the
   digitizations of real objects that have given geometric properties.
   Concepts that have been extensively studied include topological
   properties (connected components, boundaries); curves and surfaces;
   straightness, curvature, convexity, and elongatedness; distance, extent,

Abstract = {{Various relevance feedback algorithms have been proposed in recent years

   feedback as a small sample biased classification problem. As a novel
   variant of traditional discriminant analysis, the proposed algorithm
   provides a trade-off between discriminant transform and density

Title = {{Diagonalisation of a class of multivariable system via an actuator

Abstract = {{Many multivariable (systems with many inputs/outputs) industrial
   processes can, to a good degree of approximation, be modelled by a
   transfer function matrix, where all of the interaction occurs in a
   matrix of constant coefficients. This reflects the fact that the
   dynamics of the section in which the interaction occurs are very fast
   compared with the other dynamics in the system. Examples of such systems
   include steel rolling mills and boiler systems.
   Such multivariable systems are relatively easy to design controllers
   for, since the system may be diagonalised by an inverse of the constant
   gain matrix, followed by suitable single-loop dynamic compensation.
   However, this approach depends on the linearity of the dynamical
   elements in the system. Such a condition is voilated by the presence of
   non-linear actuators, which are a feature of many industrial systems.
   The presence of such actuators within a multivariable control system as
   described above can cause very significant interaction problems, with
   associated degradation in performance, particularly during transients.
   This paper describes a straightforward technique, which is effective in
   linearising typical non-linear industrial actuators, allowing
   diagonalisation to be effectively achieved at all frequencies. The
   technique relies on a simple describing function analysis and manifests
   itself as a time-varying linearising precompensator for each non-linear
   actuator. A simple example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the method and it is then shown in application with multivariable boiler
   and steel mill models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report our recent work on closed form solutions to the
   blocking and dropping probability in wireless cellular networks with
   handoff. First, we develop a performance model of a cell in a wireless
   network where the effect of handoff arrival and the use of guard
   channels are included. Fast recursive formulas for the loss
   probabilities of new calls and handoff calls are given. Algorithms to
   determine the optimal number of guard channels and the optimal number of
   channels are developed. To determine the handoff arrival rate into a
   cell, a fixed-point iteration scheme is proposed, and the uniqueness of
   the fixed-point is shown. Then, we allow for failure and repair of
   channels and hence provide a performability analysis for cellular
   systems. We present a hierarchical model combining both performance and
   availability and its closed form solution. Performability measures of
   interest are explicitly given. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Title = {{A novel fuzzy logic approach to mammogram contrast enhancement}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer continues to be a significant public health problem in the
   United States. Primary prevention seems impossible since the causes of
   this disease still remain unknown. Early detection is the key to
   improving breast cancer prognosis. Mammography has been one of the most
   reliable methods for early detection of breast carcinomas. However, it
   is difficult for radiologists to provide both accurate and uniform
   evaluation for the enormous number of mammograms generated in widespread
   screening. Automated breast cancer diagnosis attracts much attention of
   the researchers. However, the fuzzy nature of the mammograms and the low
   contrast between the breast cancer and its surroundings make the
   automated breast cancer detection very difficult. Mammogram. contrast
   enhancement is critical and essential to breast cancer diagnosis.
   This paper uses an adaptive fuzzy logic contrast enhancement method to
   enhance mammographic features. We first normalize the mammograms to
   reduce the effects of different illuminations. Then, we fuzzify the
   normalized images based on the maximum fuzzy entropy principle. The
   local contrast is measured and enhanced by utilizing both the global and
   local information so that the fine details of mammograms can be enhanced
   and the noise can be suppressed. The histogram of the mammogram provides
   the global information and the fuzzy entropy of local window is computed
   to analyze the local information. Then, we use both the global and local
   information to define and enhance the contrast. Finally, the
   defuzzification is performed to transform the enhanced mammograrn back
   to the spatial domain. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed
   method can effectively enhance the contours and fine details of the
   mamographic features which will be useful for breast cancer diagnosis.

   outliers. In this paper, fuzzy weights are used in the BT to reduce the
   affection of outliers. Every observation is selected according to the
   fuzzy weights when bootstrap samples are generated. The new BT procedure
   is called the fuzzy-weighted bootstrap test (FWBT) procedure. Simulation
   results show that the FWBT is less sensitive to outliers and the test
   result is stable. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to improve retrieval performance of the
   vector space model (VSM) in part by utilizing user-supplied information
   of those documents that are relevant to the query in question. In
   addition to the user's relevance feedback information, information such
   as original document similarities is incorporated into the retrieval
   model, which is built by using a sequence of linear transformations.
   High-dimensional and sparse vectors are then reduced by singular value
   decomposition (SVD) and transformed into a low-dimensional vector space,
   namely the space representing the latent semantic meanings of words. The
   method has been tested with two test collections, the Medline collection
   and the Cranfield collection. In order to train the model, multiple
   partitions are created for each collection. Improvement of average
   precision of the averages over all partitions, compared with the latent
   semantic indexing (LSI) model, are 20.57\% (Medline) and 22.23\%
   (Cranfield) for the two training data sets, and 0.47\% (Medline) and
   4.78\% (Cranfield) for the test data, respectively. The proposed method
   provides an approach that makes it possible to preserve user-supplied
   relevance information for the long term in the system in order to use it
   later. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the human evaluation of ILIAD, a program for
   machine-aided indexing (MAI). It consists of two language engineering
   modules and is designed to assist expert librarians in computer-aided
   indexing and document analysis. Our aim is the expert evaluation of
   automatic multi-word term indexing. Evaluation is performed by
   documentary engineers. Cataloging and indexing are their principal
   tasks. They also have a good scientific knowledge of the domain to which
   the indexed documents belong.
   We first present the ILIAD program and the two systems submitted to this
   evaluation, the methodology (protocol) adopted, the differences between
   the protocol and the implementation, and the results of these
   evaluations. Human evaluation is divided into three parts: firstly the
   evaluation of controlled indexing, then free indexing and finally term
   variant extraction performed during controlled indexing. Finally, we
   analyze the relevance of this evaluation by calculating the agreement
   frequency and the Kappa coefficient and propose some future
   developments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a strategy for building a morphological machine
   dictionary of English that infers meaning of derivations by considering
   morphological affixes and their semantic classification. Derivations are
   grouped into a frame that is accessible to semantic stem and knowledge
   base. This paper also proposes an efficient method for selecting
   compound Field Association (FA) terms from a large pool of single FA
   terms for some specialized fields. For single FA terms, five levels of
   association are defined and two ranks are defined, based on stability
   and inheritance. About 85\% of redundant compound FA terms can be
   removed effectively by using levels and ranks proposed in this paper.
   Recall averages of 60-80\% are achieved, depending on the type of text.
   The proposed methods are applied to 22,000 relationships between verbs
   and nouns extracted from the large tagged corpus. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A general method is presented to construct ordered similarity measures
   (OS-measures), i.e., similarity measures for ordered sets of documents
   (as, e.g., being the result of an IR-process), based on classical,
   well-known similarity measures for ordinary sets (measures such as
   Jaccard, Dice, Cosine or overlap measures). To this extent, we first
   present a review of these measures and their relationships.
   The method given here to construct OS-measures extends the one given by
   Michel in a previous paper so that it becomes applicable on any pair of
   ordered sets. Concrete expressions of this method, applied to the
   classical similarity measures, are given.
   Some of these measures are then tested in the IR-system Profil-Doc. The
   engine SPIRIT extracts ranked document sets in three different contexts,
   each for 550 requests. The practical usability of the OS-measures is
   then discussed based on these experiments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Rough set based data analysis starts from a data table, called an
   information system. The information system contains data about objects
   of interest characterized in terms of some attributes. Often we
   distinguish in the information system condition and decision attributes.
   Such information system is called a decision table. The decision table
   describes decisions in terms of conditions that must be satisfied in
   order to carry out the decision specified in the decision table. With
   every decision table a set of decision rules, called a decision
   algorithm can be associated. It is shown that every decision algorithm
   reveals some well-known probabilistic properties, in particular it
   satisfies the total probability theorem and the Bayes' theorem. These
   properties give a new method of drawing conclusions from data, without
   referring to prior and posterior probabilities, inherently associated
   with Bayesian reasoning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, fuzzy quantitative models of language statistics are
   constructed. All suggested models are based on the assumption about a
   superposition of two kinds of uncertainties: probabilistic and
   possibilistic. The realization of this superposition in statistical
   distributions is achieved by the probability measure splitting
   procedure. In this way, the fuzzy versions of generalized binomial,
   Fucks and Zipf-Mandelbrot's distributions are constructed describing the
   probabilistic and possibilistic organization of language at any level:
   morphological, syntactic or phonological. The main problem when
   constructing the quantitative model of some fuzzy linear structure is
   finding the corresponding linguistic spectrum, which is reduced to the
   solution of algebraic or transcendental equation systems by inverse
   spline-interpolation. In the final section, the general linear
   mathematical model of language structures is then described briefly, as
   well as bag statistics for consonantal structures of languages. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{By a data conflict in a distributed system we understand a situation (or
   a state of the system) in which the system sites generate and store
   different versions of data which represent the same subject (problem
   solution, event scenario, etc.). Thus in purpose to solve this problem
   the management system should determine one proper version for the data.
   The final data version is called a consensus of given versions. In this
   paper for given conflict situation we propose to solve a consensus
   problem by means of a consensus function. We present elements of a
   consensus system, the postulates for consensus choice functions, their
   analysis and algorithms for consensus determining. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{Restructuring the concurrent B+-tree with non-blocked search operations}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{147}},

Pages = {{123-142}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Database systems frequently establish the B-tree style indexes for fast
   access to data records. Since the B-tree index could be a performance
   bottleneck, many concurrent algorithms have been proposed to improve
   concurrency of B-tree accesses. In this paper we propose a new
   concurrent B+-tree algorithm that provides high concurrency and an
   efficient tree restructuring method. As the proposed method of tree
   restructuring always preserves a semantically consistent state of the
   B+-tree, a key searcher need not require any lock for a range search and
   a single-key search. When handling overflow or underflow in leaf nodes,
   it is very crucial to maintain correctly the link fields at the leaf
   level constructed for efficient range searches. For this, we make each
   leaf node contain two key-range indicators and develop a tree
   restructuring method using these key-range indicators.,In addition,
   since We prevent update processes from accessing nodes updated by others
   that do not commit, a recovery capability on the proposed B+-tree can be
   easily achieved based on the record-oriented redo/undo. (C) 2002

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{143-191}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Uncertain conditional propositions or conditional events pose a special
   problem for deduction due to their three-valued nature - true, false or
   inapplicable. This three-valued-ness gives rise to several different
   kinds of deduction between conditionals depending upon the particular
   deductive relation being employed. There is a hierarchy of 13 deductive
   relations between conditionals built up from four elementary ones, which
   can be expressed in terms of Boolean relations on the components of the
   conditionals. These different, but interrelated deductive relations on
   conditionals in turn give rise to various deductively closed systems of
   conditionals. Theorems are proved relating the deductive relations with
   each other and with their associated deductively closed sets (DCSs). The
   principal DCS generated by a single conditional using any of the
   deductive relations is completely characterized. Except for two of the
   deductive relations, deduction with a finite number of conditionals or
   with additional conditional information is also completely characterized
   as the union of associated principal DCSs. Examples of finite sets of,
   deductively closed conditionals are exhibited including many, unlike
   Boolean algebra, which are finite and yet non-principal, that is, not
   generated by any one conditional. An introductory section carefully
   provides motivations and a complete algebraic characterization of the
   four chosen operations on conditional events. Results are applied to,
   the famous penguin problem. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the notion of fuzzy association rules that are of
   the form X double right arrow Y, where either X or Y is a collection of
   fuzzy sets. The work stems from two observations. First, in generalized
   association rule mining, the taxonomies concerned may not be crisp but
   fuzzy (e.g., ``Tomato{''} could be regarded as both ``Fruit{''} and
   ``Vegetable{''}, each at a different degree). Second, managers often
   refer to decision rules in terms of linguistic expressions that may or
   may not be the nodes of the taxonomies (e.g., ``VERY `Expensive cloth'
   `` double right arrow ``Tropical fruit{''}). The paper deals with the
   fuzziness based upon fuzzy taxonomies that reflect partial belongings
   among itemsets, as well as upon the extended settings for the degree of
   support and the degree of confidence. Apriori algorithms are extended
   accordingly to discover association rules across the higher-level
   taxonomic nodes which are fuzzy sets in general. As a result, the
   discovered rules are fuzzy rules. Furthermore, linguistic hedges are
   also incorporated in mining fuzzy rules to express more meaningful
   knowledge. Moreover, the extended algorithms are tested with the
   synthetic data, revealing similar computational complexities to that of
   the classical algorithm. Finally, the extended algorithms are applied to
   a real data set with an explanation of the semantics of discovered fuzzy
   rules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A learning scheme is developed to generate robotic locomotion on
   different sloping surfaces. This scheme uses three neural networks: a
   neural network controller, a neural network emulator, and a slope
   information neural network. The neural network controller is pre-trained
   by a reference trajectory on a horizontal surface. The emulator is
   pre-trained to identify the robotic dynamics. The slope information
   neural network provides compensated control signals to the robot on
   different slope angles by using the control signals on the horizontal
   surface from the pre-trained controller. The training rule is a
   backpropogation algorithm with time delay. The proposed technique can
   generate gaits on different sloping surfaces by following a reference
   trajectory with desired step length, crossing height and walking speed.

Abstract = {{In a transaction-time temporal object database management system
   (TODBMS), updating an object creates a new version of the object, but
   the old version is still accessible. A TODBMS will store large amounts
   of data, and in order to provide the necessary computing power and data
   bandwidth, a parallel system based on a shared-nothing architecture is
   necessary. In order to benefit from a parallel architecture, a suitable
   declustering of the objects over the nodes in the system is important.
   In this paper, we study three low-cost declustering algorithms: (1)
   declustering based on the hash value of the OID of the objects, (2)
   range partitioning based on the timestamp of the objects, and (3) a new
   hybrid algorithm, where current object versions are declustered
   according to the hash value of the OID, and the historical versions are
   range partitioned based on timestamp. In contrast to many similar
   studies, we study the performance with a workload including both read
   and update operations. We show that strategies 1 and 3 are the most
   scalable strategies, and that the new hybrid declustering strategy is
   especially suitable for low update rates, for example in geographical
   information systems and decision support systems with support for
   temporal data. However, in general declustering based on the hash value
   of the OID of the objects has the most stable and predictable
   performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent researches have clarified that the function of protein depends on
   its molecular surface. They suggest the possibility of the protein
   function identification based on the molecular surface comparison, in
   which a molecular surface of an unknown protein is compared with many
   surfaces of known active sites as reference templates. This paper
   presents an effective surface comparison method by using normal vectors
   with attributes of the curvature and the physical properties on
   projections and depressions. The vectors that should be matched are
   limited by extracting two vectors at similar relative positions and with
   the attributes of surface in order to reduce computational complexity.
   The proposed method was applied to 11 surface data. As a result, the
   mean calculation time was about 3 min, and it was possible to compare at
   approximately an optimal location. This method was applied to 103
   surface data. The result of identification showed 95.2\% identification
   accuracy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is becoming clear that the function of protein is activated by a
   local part of its molecular surface called an active site. It is
   impractical to compare the input surface with all of the stored active
   site data, because thousands of active site data whose functions are
   known have been stored in the active site DB. This paper proposes a
   method of active site data filtering, in which only the limited active
   site data that are expected to be similar to the input protein are
   roughly filtered for the high-speed retrieval. In this method,
   characteristic regions, which are defined as parts of the surface that
   show a similar property, are extracted based on the idea that some
   similar regions in property and shape are observed in a set of similar
   protein surfaces. A similarity score between input protein and an active
   site is roughly calculated by using characteristic regions extracted
   from each of them. The method was applied to a set of 556 enzyme
   proteins. The effectiveness of the method was confirmed by the fact that
   it can shorten the retrieval time to 7.2\% of the total retrieval for
   90.2\% input proteins. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Variations in oligonucleotide microarray probe signals that result from
   various factors, including differences in sample concentrations, can
   lead to major problems in the interpretation of data obtained from
   different experiments. Normalization of such signals is typically
   performed by procedures involving division by a constant approximately
   determined by average signal intensities as, e.g., in the Affymetrix
   software. Here we show that Affymetrix oligonucleotide probe signal
   distributions can be fitted by using a superposition of two normal or
   two extreme distributions, and that by using such distributions we can
   normalize data with high accuracy (parametric algorithm). We also
   developed a second algorithm (nonparametric) based on ranking of signal
   intensities which gave equal or better normalization than the parametric
   one. These approaches have been used for normalization of three sets of
   data obtained from cancer cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   from patients with HIV infections, and adipose cells from patients with
   diabetes, and others. Both, parametric and nonparametric normalization
   procedures, were found to be superior when compared to the standard
   global normalization approach {[}Affymetrix Microarray Suite User Guide.
   Version 4.0 (2000)]. These results suggest that the new approaches may
   be helpful for microarray data normalization especially for comparison
   of clinical data where interpatient differences can be large and
   difficult to avoid. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Microarray expression data is being generated by the gigabyte all over
   the world with undoubted exponential increases to come. Annotated
   genomic data is also rapidly pouring into public databases. Our goal is
   to develop automated ways of combining these two sources of information
   to produce insight into the operation of cells under various conditions.
   Our approach is to use machine-learning techniques to identify
   characteristics of genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in a
   particular microarray experiment. We seek models that are (a) accurate,
   (b) easy to interpret, and (c) stable to small variations in the
   training data. This paper explores the effectiveness of two standard
   machine-learning algorithms for this task: Naive Bayes (based on
   probability) and PFOIL (based on building rules). Although we do not
   anticipate using our learned models to predict expression levels of
   genes, we cast the task in a predictive framework, and evaluate the
   quality of the models in terms of their predictive power on genes held
   out from the training. The paper reports on experiments using actual E
   coli microarray data, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the two
   algorithms and demonstrating the trade-offs between accuracy,
   comprehensibility, and stability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{In recent years a number of methods have been proposed for reverse
   engineering of genetic networks from gene expression data. These methods
   work well on small genetic networks with very few connections between
   genes, but for larger networks and networks with higher connectivity,
   the computational cost increases dramatically and the performance of
   these methods is insufficient. In real systems, however, it is known
   that the networks are large and that genes typically have many
   interactions. In addition, the methods require abundant expression data
   for derivation of the networks. A method that can derive networks
   irrespective of these obstacles and have a low computational cost will
   be of importance. In this paper, three correlation-based methods are
   investigated as alternatives. Using correlation-based methods means that
   the computational cost-is reduced, since only N/2 correlations have to
   be computed-for a data set of N expression profiles. The presented
   methods are not limited by any maximum size of the network, nor by the
   connectivity of the network, or the amount of expression data. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting multiple unordered
   short motifs in upstream regions of given genes. Multiple unordered
   short motifs can be considered as a set of short motifs, say M = \{m(1),
   m(2),..., m(k)\}. For a gene g, if each of the motifs m(1),..., m(k)
   occurs in either the upstream region or its complement of g, the gene g
   is said to be consistent with M. We have developed a fast method to
   exhaustively search collections of short motifs over given short motifs
   for a particular set of genes, and rank collections with using multiple
   objective functions. This method is implemented by employing bit
   operations in the process of matching short motifs with upstream
   regions, and identifying the members of genes which are consistent with
   short motifs. On various putatively co-regulated genes of Sacchromyces
   cerevisiae, determined by gene expression profiles, our computational
   experiments show biologically,interesting results. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{DNA sequence, gene and genome databases are rapidly expanding due to
   advances in genomics instrumentation, technology and methodology. These
   advances impact many areas of research. For example, comparative
   virology is enhanced by data mining these expanding databases. Due to
   the immense amount of data, more and better computational tools and
   methods are needed to mine this data. GeneOrder2.0 and CoreGenes are two
   recently developed Java-based interactive computational tools that have
   applications in ``whole genome{''} analyses. They have been used to
   examine several chordopoxvirus genomes for their gene content and
   context. Results include identifying gene order in pairs of
   chordopoxviruses, e.g., genome co-linearity, and generating a matrix of
   orthologous genes amongst representative genomes. These tools give a
   highly effective visualization of these and other related and
   semi-related genomes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Online analytical processing (OLAP) systems have been introduced to

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Sorting in database processing is frequently required through the use of
   Order By and Distinct clauses in SQL. Sorting is also widely known in
   computer science community at large. Sorting in general covers internal
   and external sorting. Past published work has extensively focused on
   external sorting on uni-processors (serial external sorting), and
   internal sorting on multi-processors (parallel internal sorting).
   External sorting on multi-processors (parallel external sorting) has
   received surprisingly little attention; furthermore, the way current
   parallel database systems do sorting is far from optimal in many
   scenarios. In this paper, we present a taxonomy for parallel sorting in
   parallel database systems, which covers five sorting methods: namely
   parallel merge-all sort, parallel binary-merge sort, parallel
   redistribution binary-merge sort, parallel redistribution merge-all
   sort, and parallel partitioned sort. The first two methods are
   previously proposed approaches to parallel external sorting which have
   been adopted as status quo of parallel database sorting, whereas the
   latter three methods which are based on redistribution and
   repartitioning are new that have not been discussed in the literature of
   parallel external sorting. Performance of these five methods is
   investigated and the results are reported. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The subject of context has received a great deal of attention in the
   information retrieval (IR) literature over the past decade, primarily in
   studies of information seeking and IR interactions. Recently, attention
   to context in IR has expanded to address new problems in new
   environments. In this paper we outline five overlapping dimensions of
   context which we believe to be important constituent elements and we
   discuss how they are related to different issues in IR research. The
   papers in this special issue are summarized with respect to how they
   represent work that is being conducted within these dimensions of
   context. We conclude with future areas of research which arc needed in
   order to fully understand the multidimensional nature of context in IR.

Abstract = {{In human-computer interaction (HCI), a successful interaction sequence
   can take its own momentum and drift away from what the user has
   originally planned. However, this does not mean that planned actions p
   lay no important role in the overall performance. In this paper, the
   author tries to construct a line of argument to demonstrate that it is
   impossible to consider an action without an a priori plan, even
   according to the phenomenological position taken for granted by the
   situated action theory. Based on the phenomenological analysis of
   problematic Situations and typification the author argues that, just
   like ``situated-ness{''}, ``planned-ness{''} of an action should also be
   understood in the context of the situation. Successful plan can be
   developed and executed for familiar context. The first part of the paper
   treats information seeking behavior as a special type of social action
   and applies Alfred Schutz's phenomenology of sociology to understand the
   importance and necessity of plan. The second part reports results of a
   quasi-experiment focusing on plan deviation within an information
   seeking context. It was found that when the searcher's situation changed
   from problematic to non-problematic, the degree of plan deviation
   decreased significantly. These results support the argument proposed in
   the first part of the paper. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of general audience digital libraries (GADLs) defines a
   context that represents a hybrid of both ``traditional{''} IR, using
   primarily bibliographic resources provided by database vendors, and
   ``popular{''} IR, exemplified by public search systems available on the
   World Wide Web. Findings of a study investigating end-user searching and
   response to a GADL are reported. Data collected from a Web-based
   end-user survey and data logs of resource usage for a Web-based GADL
   were analyzed for user characteristics, patterns of access and use, and
   user feedback. Cross-tabulations using respondent demographics revealed
   several key differences in how the system was used and valued by users
   of different age groups. Older users valued the service more than
   younger users and engaged in different searching and viewing behaviors,
   The GAD L more closely resembles traditional retrieval systems in terms
   of content and purpose of use, but is more similar to popular IR systems
   in tern-is of user behavior and accessibility. A model that defines the
   dual context of the GADL environment is derived from the data analysis
   and existing IR models in general and other specific contexts. The
   authors demonstrate the distinguishing characteristics of this IR
   context, and discuss implications for the development and evaluation of
   future GADLs to accommodate a variety of user needs and expectations.

Abstract = {{This study examined the success and information seeking behaviors of
   seventh-grade science students and graduate students in information
   science in using Yahooligans! Web search engine/directory. It
   investigated these users cognitive, affective, and physical behaviors as
   they sought the answer for a fact-finding task. It analyzed and compared
   the overall patterns of children's and graduate students' Web
   activities, including searching moves, browsing moves, backtracking
   moves, looping moves, screen scrolling, target location and deviation
   moves, and the time they took to complete the task. The authors applied
   Bilal's Web Traversal Measure to quantify these uscrs effectiveness,
   efficiency, and quality of moves they made. Results were based on 14
   children's Web sessions and nine graduate students' sessions. Both
   groups' Web activities were captured online using Lotus ScreenCam, a
   software package that records and replays online activities in Web
   browsers. Children's affective states were captured via exit interviews.
   Graduate students' affective states were extracted from the journal
   writings they kept during the traversal process. The study findings
   reveal that 89\% of the graduate students found the correct answer to
   the search task as opposed to 50\%, of the children. Based on the
   Measure, graduate students' weighted effectiveness, efficiency, and
   quality of the Web moves they made were much higher than those of the
   children. Regardless of success and weighted scores, however,
   similarities and differences in information seeking were found between
   the two groups. Yahooligans! poor structure of keyword searching was a
   major factor that contributed to the ``breakdowns{''} children and
   graduate students experienced. Unlike children, graduate students were
   able to recover from ``breakdowns{''} quickly and effectively. Three
   main factors influenced these users' performance: ability to recover
   from ``breakdowns{''}, navigational style, and focus on task. Children
   and graduate students made recommendations for improving Yahooligans!
   interface design. Implications for Web user training and system design
   improvements are made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to see how relevance feedback could be used
   to build and adjust profiles to improve the performance of filtering
   systems. Data was collected during the system interaction of IS graduate
   students with SIFTER (Smart Information Filtering Technology for
   Electronic Resources), a filtering system that ranks incoming
   information based on users' profiles. The data set came from a
   collection of 6000 records concerning consumer health. In the first
   phase of the study, three different modes of profile acquisition were
   compared. The explicit mode allowed users to directly specify the
   profile, the implicit mode utilized relevance feedback to create and
   refine the profile, and the combined mode allowed users to initialize
   the profile and to continuously refine it using relevance feedback.
   Filtering performance, measured in terms of Normalized Precision, showed
   that {[}lie three approaches were significantly different (alpha = 0.05
   and p = 0.012). The explicit mode of profile acquisition consistently
   produced superior results. Exclusive reliance on relevance feedback in
   the implicit mode resulted in inferior performance. The low performance
   obtained by the implicit acquisition mode motivated the second phase of
   the study, which aimed to clarify the role of context in relevance
   feedback judgments. An inductive content analysis of thinking aloud
   protocols showed dimensions that were highly situational, establishing
   the importance context plays in feedback relevance assessments. Results
   suggest the need for better representation of documents, profiles, and
   relevance feedback mechanisms that incorporate dimensions identified in
   this research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Users' relevance criteria in image retrieval in American history}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2002}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A large number of digital images are available and accessible due to
   recent advances in technology. Since image retrieval systems are
   designed to meet user information needs, it seems apparent that image
   retrieval system design and implementation should take into account
   user-based aspects such as information use patterns and relevance
   judgments. However, little is known about what criteria users employ
   when making relevance judgments and which textual represen tat ions of
   the image help them make relevance judgments in their situational
   context.
   Thus, this study attempted to investigate the criteria which image users
   apply when making judgments about the relevance of an image. This
   research was built on prior work by Barry, Schamber and others which
   examined relevance criteria for textual and non-textual documents,
   exploring the extent to which these criteria apply to visual documents
   and the extent to which new and different criteria apply. Data were
   collected from unstructured interviews and questionnaires. Quantitative
   statistical methods were employed to analyze the importance of relevance
   criteria to see how much each criterion affected the user's judgments.
   The study involved 38 faculty and graduate students of American history
   in 1999 in a local setting, using the Library of Congress American
   memory photo archives.
   The study found that the user's perception of topicality was still the
   most important factor across the information-seeking stages. However,
   the users decided on retrieved items according to a variety of criteria
   other than topicality. Image quality and clarity was important. Users
   also searched for relevant images on the basis of title, date, subject
   descriptors. and notes provided. The conclusions of this study will be
   useful in image database design to assist users in conducting image
   searches. This study can be helpful to future relevance studies in
   information system design and evaluation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Contextual information provides an important basis for identifying and
   understanding users' information needs. Our previous work in traditional
   information retrieval systems has shown how using contextual information
   could improve retrieval performance. With the vast quantity and variety
   of information available on the Web, and the short query lengths within
   Web searches, it becomes even more crucial that appropriate contextual
   information is extracted to facilitate personalized services. However,
   finding users' contextual information is not straightforward, especially
   in the Web search environment where less is known about the individual
   users. In this paper, we will present an approach that has significant
   potential for studying Web users' search contexts. The approach
   automatically groups a user's consecutive search activities on the same
   search topic into one session. It uses Dempster-Shafer theory to combine
   evidence extracted from two sources, each of which is based on the
   statistical data from Web search logs. The evaluation we have performed
   demonstrates that our approach has achieved a significant improvement
   over previous methods of session identification. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The goal of many gene expression experiments is to discover genes that
   are functionally related by clustering expression levels sampled over
   some time interval, with the hope that co-regulated genes also are
   functionally related. However, it is not necessarily always true that
   co-regulated genes are functionally related, or vice versa, and
   therefore this paper investigates the value of including gene annotation
   in the clustering process. Results suggest that clusters formed by a
   clustering of a combination of expression data and annotation in the
   form of enzyme classification can give results that have higher
   correlation with known biological data (functional and metabolic
   pathway) not included in the clustering process. The results show that
   the same is true even in a situation with only 10\% of the dataset
   annotated, which is an estimate of the amount of enzymatic annotation
   available today and a sign that the inclusion of added data helps in the
   clustering of genes without any explicit annotation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{TGF-beta cytokines and their interacting receptors form an intricate
   signaling network and. play important roles in cell differentiation and
   development. Members in gene families involved in this complicated
   pathway are usually conserved in sequence but distinct in temporal and
   tissue-specific expression. Starting from an evolutionary perspective,
   we have statistically tested the functional divergence in major pathway
   components, targeted the critical amino acid residues responsible for
   functional divergence. Our results show that altered functional
   constraints is a common pattern in the evolution of TGF-beta pathway.
   Moreover, we have found the correlation between structural divergence
   and functional divergence in the extracellular ligand-binding domain of
   Type II receptors. This study helps understand the complex intrinsic
   mechanisms of signaling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings obtained through the statistical

   mutated anti-lysozyme antibody HyHEL-10. The data contained amino-acid

   thermodynamic measurements such as entropy and enthalpy. We examined the
   contribution of each of the mutated sites on VH and VL chains of
   HyHEL-10 to the change of measurements by using the generalized linear
   model (GLM). Following results were obtained: (1) the sites VH32, 33, 50
   and temperature had high partial correlations to the change of entropy
   (DH) and enthalpy (TDS), (2) the sites VH53 and 58 had high partial
   correlations to the change of specific heat (DCp), (3) the sites VL31,
   32 and temperature had high partial correlations to the change of free
   energy (DG), DH, TDS and DCp. The results also suggested that the
   behavior of DH, TDS and DCp were well represented by GLM, however, the
   behavior of combining coefficient (K-a) should have a statistical nature

   main target of the modeling is the gene regulatory network. A hybrid
   method of Genetic Programming (GP) and statistical analysis is featured
   in our work. GP and Least Mean Square method (LMS) were combined to
   identify a concise form of regulation between the variables from a given
   set of time series. Our approach was evaluated in several real-world
   problems. Further, Monte Carlo analysis is applied to indicate the
   robust and significant influence from the results for gene network
   analysis purpose. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While nucleotide substitutions in both regulatory and coding regions are
   the two facets of functional divergence after gene duplication, evidence
   is limited for our understanding the extent to which regulatory changes
   can occur after gene (genome) duplication. Fortunately, the complete
   yeast genome sequence and the whole-genome micro-array expression data
   provide a unique opportunity for resolving this issue. In the yeast
   genome, a genome-wide duplication may result in 54 homologous chromosome
   block pairs, including 452 gene pairs. On the other hand, Chu et al.
   {[}Science 282 (1998) 6991 used DNA micro-arrays containing nearly every
   yeast gene to assay changes in gene expression during sporulation, which
   consists of meiosis and spore morphogenesis. Our results have shown
   that, for a subset of gene pairs that at least one duplicate gene is
   induced during sporulation, there is a significant association between
   expression and the presence of DNA binding site MSE, while no such
   association is observed for the rest of homologous gene pairs. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The control of autonomous intelligent robotic agent operating in
   unstructured changing environments includes many objective difficulties.
   One major difficulty concerns the characteristics of the environment
   that the agent should operate in. In unstructured and changing
   environments the inconsistency of the terrain, the irregularity of the
   product and the open nature of the working environment result in complex
   problems of identification, sensing and control. Problems can range from
   the effects of varying environmental conditions on the robot sensors and
   traction performance through to the need to deal with the presence of
   unexpected situations. Another major challenge is the large amounts of
   uncertainty that characterises real-world environments. On the one hand,
   it is not possible to have exact and complete prior knowledge of these
   environments. On the other hand, knowledge acquired through sensing is
   affected by uncertainty and imprecision. The quality of sensor
   information is influenced by sensor noise, the limited field of view,
   the conditions of observation, and the inherent difficulty of the
   perceptual interpretation process. Because environments and users of
   systems continuously change, robotic agents have to be adaptive.
   Intelligence helps because it gives systems the capacity to adapt more
   rapidly to environmental changes or to handle much more complex
   functions. In his paper we introduce this special issue and introduce
   the difficulty robots are facing in unstructured environments and how
   learning and computational intelligence can help the robots to adapt and
   give them the necessary intelligence they to face the challenges they
   encounter in their environments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{The objective in this paper is to apply our proposed two-way fuzzy
   adaptive system that makes use of intuitionistic fuzzy sets to the
   identification and model-based control of a flexible-joint robot arm.
   Uncertainty and inconsistency are modelled in the proposed system such
   as uncertainty is the width of the interval introduced by the
   independent assignment of membership and nonmembership functions of the
   intuitionistic fuzzy sets; and inconsistency is the violation of the
   consistency inequality in this assignment. We reduce uncertainty and
   inconsistency through a two phase training. The first phase is to reduce
   inconsistency introduced by the inconsistent assignment of membership
   and nonmembership functions. The resultant system is an almost
   consistent two-way fuzzy adaptive system. Thus, an evaluation of the
   degree of reduction of inconsistency is needed and is carried out at the
   end of this phase by forming the shadowed set patterns of the membership
   and nonmembership functions after first phase of training. The system is
   further trained for a second phase in order to reduce uncertainty. The
   system performance has shown that this second phase of training renders
   the system totally one-way fuzzy adaptive. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{How to learn from both expert knowledge and measurement-based
   information for a robot to acquire perception and motor skills is a
   challenging research topic in the field of autonomous robotic systems.
   For this reason, a-general GA (genetic algorithm)-based fuzzy
   reinforcement learning (GAFRL) agent is proposed in this paper. We first
   characterize the robot learning problem and point out some major issues
   that need to be addressed in conjunction with reinforcement learning.
   Based on a neural fuzzy network architecture of the GAFRL agent, we then
   discuss how different kinds of expert knowledge and measurement-based
   information can be incorporated in the GAFRL agent so as to accelerate
   its learning. By making use of the global optimization capability of
   GAs, the GAFRL can solve the local minima problem in traditional
   actor-critic reinforcement learning. On the other hand, with the
   prediction capability of the critic network, GAs can evaluate the
   candidate solutions regularly even during the periods without external
   feedback from the environment. This can guide GAs to perform a more
   effective global search. Finally, different types of GAFRL agents are
   constructed and verified using the simulation model of a physical biped
   robot. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a system for behavior-based control of an autonomous
   underwater vehicle for the purpose of inspection of coral reefs, a task
   currently performed by divers holding a video camera while following a
   rope. Using sonar and vision-based approaches, behaviors have been
   developed for guiding the robot along its intended course, for
   maintaining a constant height above the sea floor, and for avoiding
   obstacles. A task-level controller selects which behaviors should be
   active according to user-defined plans and in response to system
   failures. Behavior arbitration has been implemented using both fuzzy
   logic and utility fusion. Initial experiments have been conducted in a
   natural coastal inlet, and the system is to be soon demonstrated in the
   coral reef environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Mechanical assembly by robots has traditionally depended on simple
   sensing systems and the robot manufacturers programming language.
   However, this restricts the use of robots in complex manufacturing
   operations. An alternative to robot programming is the creation of
   self-adaptive robots based on the adaptive resonance theory (ART)
   artificial neural network (ANN).
   The research presented in this paper shows how robots can operate
   autonomously in unstructured environments. This is achieved by providing
   the robot with a primitive knowledge base (PKB) of the environment. This
   knowledge is gradually enhanced on-line based on the contact force
   information acquired during operations.
   The robot resembles a blindfold person performing the same task since no
   information is provided about the localisation of the fixed assembly
   component. The design of a novel neural network controller (NNC) based
   on the Fuzzy ARTMAP network and its implementation results on an
   industrial robot are presented, which validate the approach. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper presents an effective generation method of adjustment
   strategies for a fuzzy-neuro force controller (FNFC) of a robot
   manipulator in an unknown environment. In this method, strategies to
   adjust the FNFC in accordance with the environment dynamics are
   automatically generated in off-line manner using genetic algorithms
   (GA). The generated strategies are stored in a neural network and used
   for adjusting the FNFC in on-line. Therefore, the FNFC is automatically
   adjusted in accordance with the unknown dynamics of an environment using
   the generated strategies which are stored in the neural network. Fuzzy
   fitness evaluation method is proposed for the effective evolution-of the
   neural network in the GA process. The effectiveness of the generated
   adjustment strategies of the FNFC has been evaluated by computer

Abstract = {{This paper describes an autonomous navigation system for a large
   underground mining vehicle. The control architecture is based on a
   robust reactive wall-following behaviour. To make it purposeful we
   provide driving hints derived from an approximate nodal-map. For most of
   the time, the vehicle is driven with weak localization (odometry). This
   need only be improved at intersections where decisions must be made - a
   technique we refer to as opportunistic localization. The paper briefly
   reviews absolute and relative navigation strategies, and describes an
   implementation of a reactive navigation system on a 30 tonne
   Load-Haul-Dump truck. This truck has achieved full-speed autonomous
   operation at an artificial test mine, and subsequently, at a operational

Abstract = {{This paper describes a neuro-fuzzy controller for autonomous underwater
   vehicles (AUVs) of which the dynamics are highly nonlinear, coupled, and
   time-varying. The neuro-fuzzy controller is based on the fuzzy
   membership function-based neural networks (FMFNNs) with advantages of
   fuzzy logics and neural networks, such as inference capability and
   adoption of human operators' experience with fuzzy logics, and universal
   approximation and learning capability with neural networks. Unlike other
   conventional control approaches, the presented FMFNN controller does not
   require any information about the system, off-line learning procedures,
   or human intervention to adjust parameters. On-line learning of the
   FMFNN controller is achieved by using an inner-loop learning scheme and
   simplified derivatives of the vehicle system. Simulation results show
   effectiveness of the FMFNN controller for AUVs. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{Web queries in question format are becoming a common element of a user's
   interaction with Web search engines. Web search services such as Ask
   Jeeves - a publicly accessible question and answer (Q\&A) search engine
   - request users to enter question format queries. This paper provides
   results from a study examining queries in question format submitted to
   two different Web search engines - Ask Jeeves that explicitly encourages
   queries in question format and the Excite search service that does not
   explicitly encourage queries in question format. We identify the
   characteristics of queries in question format in two different data
   sets: (1) 30,000 Ask Jeeves queries and 15.575 Excite queries, including
   the nature, length, and structure of queries in question format.
   Findings include: (1) 50\% of Ask Jeeves queries and less than 1\% of
   Excite were in question format, (2) most users entered only one query in
   question format with little query reformulation, (3) limited range of
   formats for queries in question format - mainly ``where{''}, ``what{''},
   or ``how{''} questions, (4) most common question query format was
   ``Where can I find..........{''} for general information on a topic. and
   (5) non-question queries may be in request format. Overall, four types
   of user Web queries were identified: keyword, Boolean, question, and
   request. These findings provide an initial mapping of the structure and
   content of queries in question and request format. Implications for Web
   search services are discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Search engines are the gateway for users to retrieve information from
   the Web. There is a crucial need for tools that allow effective analysis
   of search engine queries to provide a greater understanding of Web
   users' information seeking behavior. The objective of the study is to
   develop an effective strategy for the selection of samples from
   large-scale data sets. Millions of queries are submitted to Web search
   engines daily and new sampling techniques are required to bring these
   databases to a manageable size, while preserving the statistically
   representative characteristics or the entire data set. This paper
   reports results from a study using data logs from the Excite Web search
   engine, We use Poisson sampling to develop a sampling strategy. and show
   how sample sets selected by Poisson sampling statistically effectively
   represent the characteristics of the entire dataset. In addition, this
   paper discusses the use of Poisson sampling in continuous monitoring of
   stochastic processes, such as Web site dynamics. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{Author co-citation analysis (ACA) has been widely used in bibliometrics
   as an analytical method in analyzing the intellectual structure of
   science studies. It can be used to identify authors from the same or
   similar research fields. However, such analysis method relies heavily on
   statistical tools to perform the analysis and requires human
   interpretation, Web Citation Database is a data warehouse used for
   storing citation indices of Web publications. In this paper. we propose
   a mining process to automate the ACA based on the Web Citation Database.
   The mining process uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) as
   the mining technique for author clustering and multidimensional scaling
   (MDS) for displaying author cluster maps. The clustering results and
   author cluster map have been incorporated into a citation-based
   retrieval system known as PubSearch to support author retrieval of Web
   publications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most work in NLP requires that texts have been previously segmented into
   sentences and words. Segmenting a text into sentences and words,
   however, is a complex task, due to the ambiguity of many punctuation
   marks and spaces. Furthermore, Web texts such as HTML documents are more
   difficult to make into well refined and segmented texts because they are
   described in a more free style, with many sentence boundary and spacing
   errors. The objective of this paper introduces a multi-strategic
   integrated text preprocessing method for difficult problems of sentence
   boundary disambiguation and word boundary disambiguation of Web texts.
   We have applied a hybrid method (the regular expression rule, the
   heuristic rule, and the inductive learning of statistical decision
   trees, using a C4.5 learner) synergically to the task of raw corpus
   preprocessing. This work contributes to a more correct morphological
   analysis and guarantees a more stable working of application systems. We
   tackle easily definable problems with automatically acquired constraints
   and we use inductively learned decision trees to solve ill-defined
   ambiguity problems by incorporating multiple features (n-grams, relative
   frequency, entropy, tri-dictionary index). The multistrategy approach
   was thoroughly tested: it achieved approximately 99.12\% (with
   punctuation marks) and 98.04\% (without any punctuation marks) accuracy
   in sentence boundary disambiguation, 95.39\% accuracy of word spacing
   correction, and 94.61\% accuracy for whole intermixed text preprocessing
   problems. from Korean news script Web documents. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an efficient text categorization algorithm
   that generates bigrams selectively by looking for ones that have an
   especially good chance of being useful. The algorithm uses the
   information gain metric, combined with various frequency thresholds. The
   bigrams, along with unigrams, are then given as features to two
   different classifiers: Naive Bayes and maximum entropy. The experimental
   results suggest that the bigrams can substantially raise the quality of
   feature sets, showing increases in the break-even points and F I
   measures. The McNemar test shows that in most categories the increases
   are very significant. Upon close examination of the algorithm, we
   concluded that the algorithm is most successful in correctly classifying
   more positive documents, but may cause more negative documents to be
   classified incorrectly. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hierarchic document clustering has been widely applied to information
   retrieval (IR) on the grounds of its potential improved effectiveness
   over inverted file search (IFS). However, previous research has been
   inconclusive as to whether clustering does bring improvements. In this
   paper we take the view that if hierarchic clustering is applied to
   search results (query-specific clustering), then it has the potential to
   increase the retrieval effectiveness compared both to that or static
   clustering and of conventional IFS. We conducted a number of experiments
   using five document collections and four hierarchic clustering methods.
   Our results show that the effectiveness of query-specific clustering is
   indeed higher, and suggest that there is scope for its application to
   IR. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach for classifying text documents into
   two disjoint classes. The new approach is based on extracting patterns.
   in the form of two logical expressions, which are defined on various
   features (indexing terms) or the documents. The pattern extraction is
   aimed at providing descriptions (in the form of two logical expressions)
   of the two classes of positive and negative examples. This is achieved
   by means or a data mining approach, called One Clause At a Time (OCAT),
   which is based on mathematical logic, The application of a logic-based
   approach to text document classification is critical when one wishes to
   be able to justify why a particular document has been assigned to one
   class versus the other class. This situation occurs, for instance, in
   declassifying documents that have been previously considered important
   to national security and thus are currently being kept as secret. Some
   Computational experiments have investigated the effectiveness of the
   OCAT-based approach and compared it to the well-known vector space model
   (VSM). These tests also have investigated finding the best indexing
   terms that could be used in making these classification decisions. The
   results of these computational experiments on a sample of 2897 text
   documents from the TIPSTER collection indicate that the first approach
   hits many advantages over the VSM approach for solving this type of text
   document classification problem. Moreover, a guided strategy for the
   OCAT-based approach is presented for deciding which document one needs
   to consider next while building the training example sets. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is
   a difficult problem for several reasons. First, behavior is such a wide
   topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in
   order to obtain a consistent model. Such a framework can be for example
   biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach.
   Second, a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully
   specified program to be implemented in a robot. Many choices, tuning and
   tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system. This paper
   describes this.
   First, a biological model is presented, based on the definition of
   cortex-like automata, representing elementary functions in the
   perceptive, motor or associative domain. These automata are connected in
   a network whose architecture, functioning and learning rules are
   described in a cortical framework.
   Second, the computational model derived from that biological model is
   specified. The way units exchange and compute variables through links is
   explained, with reference to corresponding biological elements. It is
   then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn
   regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some
   internal drives. Even if additional biological hints can be added, this
   model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be
   implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed
   set of units. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has developed a series of rail
   and rail-related analysis tools that assist FRA officials, Metropolitan
   Planning Organizations (MPOs), state Department of Transportation (DOT),
   and other constituents in evaluating the cost and benefits of potential
   infrastructure projects. To meet agency objectives, the FRA wants to add
   a high-speed rail grade crossing analysis tool to its package of rail
   and rail-related intermodal software products. This paper presents a
   conceptual decision support system (DSS) that can assist officials in
   achieving this goal.
   The paper first introduces the FRA's objectives and the role of cost
   benefit analysis in achieving these objectives. Next, there is a
   discussion of the models needed to assess the feasibility of proposed
   high-speed rail grade crossing investments and the presentation of a
   decision support system (DSS) that can deliver these models
   transparently to users. Then, the paper illustrates a system session and
   examines the potential benefits from system use. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Pages = {{91-125}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method for predicting sea levels employing
   self-organizing feature maps is introduced. For that purpose the maps
   are transformed from an unsupervised learning procedure to a supervised
   one. Two concepts, originally developed to solve the problems of
   convergence of other network types, are proposed to be applied to
   Kohonen networks: a functional relationship between the number of
   neurons and the number of learning examples and a criterion to break off
   learning. The latter one can be shown to be conform with the process of
   self-organization by using U-matrices for visualization of the learning
   procedure. The predictions made using these neural models are compared
   for accuracy with observations and with the prognoses prepared using six
   models: two hydrodynamic models, a statistical model, a nearest neighbor
   model, the persistence model, and the verbal forecasts that are
   broadcast and kept on record by the Sea Level Forecast Service of the
   Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency (BSH) in Hamburg. Before
   training the maps, the meteorological and oceanographic situation has to
   be condensed as well as possible, and the weight and learning vectors
   have to be made as small as possible. The self-organizing feature maps
   predict sea levels better than all six models of comparison. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Multi Agent Systems (MAS) have become the key technology for decomposing
   complex problems in order to solve them more efficiently, or for
   problems distributed in nature. However, many industrial applications
   besides their distributed nature, also involve a large number of
   parameters and constraints among them, i.e. they are combinatorial.
   Solving such particularly hard problems efficiently requires programming
   tools that combine MAS technology with a programming schema that
   facilitates the modeling and solution of constraints. This paper
   presents MACLP (Multi Agent Constraint Logic Programming), a
   logic-programming platform for building, in a declarative way, multi
   agent systems with constraint-solving capabilities. MACLP extends
   CSPCONS, a logic programming system that permits distributed program
   execution through communicating sequential Prolog processes with
   constraints, by providing all the necessary facilities for communication
   between agents. These facilities abstract from the programmer all the
   low-level details of the communication and allow him to focus on the
   development of the agent itself. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{Efficient construction of indexes is very important in bulk-loading a
   database or adding a new index to an existing database since both of
   them should handle an enormous volume of data. In this paper, we propose
   an algorithm for batch-constructing the B+-tree, the most widely used
   index structure in database systems. The main characteristic of our
   algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed
   on each B+-tree page when accessing the page. This avoids the overhead
   due to accessing the same page multiple times, which results from
   applying the B+-tree insertion algorithm repeatedly. For performance
   evaluation, we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of
   disk accesses. The results show that the number of disk accesses
   excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of
   pages belonging to the B+-tree. Considering that the relocation process
   is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch-constructing of B+-trees,
   our algorithm requires just one disk access per B+-tree page, and
   therefore turns out to be optimal. We also present the performance
   tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation.
   Finally, we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm,
   compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a methodological approach for
   problems encountered in structural analysis. This approach is based upon
   the pretopological concepts of pseudoclosure and minimal closed subsets.
   The advantage of this approach is that it provides a framework which is
   general enough to model and formulate different types of connections
   that exist between the elements of a population. In addition, it has
   enabled us to develop a new structural analysis algorithm. An
   explanation of the definitions and properties of the pretopological
   concepts applied in this work is first shown and illustrated in sample
   settings. The structural analysis algorithm is then described and the
   results obtained in an economic study of the impact of geographic
   proximity on scientific collaborations are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper studies the case of the representation of a binary relation
   via a numerical function with threshold (error) depending on both
   compared alternatives. The error is considered to be multiplicative, its
   value being either directly or inversely proportional to the values of
   the numerical function.
   For the first case, it is proved that a binary relation is a semiorder.
   Moreover, any semiorder can be represented in this form. In the second
   case, the corresponding binary relation is an interval order. (C) 2002

   This value obtained from our formula tell us not only the strength of

   intuitionistic fuzzy sets are positively or negatively related. This
   approach looks better than previous methods which only evaluate the
   strength of the relation. Furthermore, we extend the ``centroid{''}

Abstract = {{The PROSITE collection of patterns for family classification of protein
   sequences requires much manual labour for motif finding and pattern
   updating, and yet has only moderate classification accuracy. Out of 1026
   families with patterns in PROSITE release 16.0, there was only 523
   (51\%) with a diagnostic pattern, i.e., a pattern which discriminates
   perfectly between family and non-family sequences in the training set.
   Therefore, there is a need to find reliable methods for automating the
   processes of motif-finding and pattern construction, so that improved
   speed can be combined with greater classification accuracy.
   In this paper we present our approach to automating the construction of
   a collection of patterns, and we announce release 1.0 of the pattern
   collection built by motif-finding by analysis of multiple alignments
   (MAMA). MAMA is found to improve the classification accuracy over
   PROSITE by finding many more diagnostic patterns. On 926 tested
   families, MAMA finds such patterns for 771 (83\%). Furthermore, both the
   average specificity and sensitivity of MAMA patterns are found to be
   higher than for PROSITE.
   A WWW interface that allows users to submit sequences and scan for
   matches in the MAMA pattern collection is available,(1) together with a
   listing of all the patterns in MAMA release 1.0. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{We propose a novel architecture for a video database system
   incorporating both spatio-temporal and semantic (keyword, event/activity
   and category-based) query facilities. The originality of our approach
   stems from the fact that we intend to provide full support for
   spatio-temporal, relative object-motion and similarity-based
   object-trajectory queries by a rule-based system utilizing a
   knowledge-base while using an object-relational database to answer
   semantic-based queries. Our method of extracting and modeling
   spatio-temporal relations is also a unique one such that we segment
   video clips into shots using spatial relationships between objects in
   video frames rather than applying a traditional scene detection
   algorithm. The technique we use is simple, yet novel and powerful in
   terms of effectiveness and user query satisfaction: video clips are
   segmented into shots whenever the current set of relations between
   objects changes and the video frames, where these changes occur, are
   chosen as keyframes. The directional, topological and third-dimension
   relations used for shots are those of the keyframes selected to
   represent the shots and this information is kept, along with frame
   numbers of the keyframes, in a knowledge-base as Prolog facts. The
   system has a comprehensive set of inference rules to reduce the number
   of facts stored in the knowledge-base because a considerable number of
   facts, which otherwise would have to be stored explicitly, can be
   derived by rules with some extra effort. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{In this study, we elaborate on the role of information granulation and
   the ensuing information granules in description of time series and
   signal analysis, in general. Information granules are entities of
   elements (quite commonly, numeric data) that are combined together
   (aggregated) owing to their vicinity, similarity and alike. Proceeding
   with a given window of granulation (that is an initial collection of
   numeric data), we propose an algorithm that produces a complete
   information granule-fuzzy set. The principle supported by the method
   leads to the formation of fuzzy sets that are legitimate in terms of
   experimental data being at the same time maximized with regard to their
   specificity (compactness). It has been shown that information granules
   can be are regarded as generic conceptual entities contributing to the
   description of numeric time series. In this capacity, they are used as
   building blocks aimed at achieving high level, compact, and
   comprehensible models of signals. More importantly, the phase of
   information granulation could be viewed as a prerequisite to more

Abstract = {{In this paper a fuzzy logic based traffic junction signal controller

   simulated an environment that meets the traffic situations more than

   consecutive junctions, the number of lanes, the lengths of vehicles, and
   the lengths of streets. Compared with existing studies, the proposed
   fuzzy controller has the following characteristics: different input
   variables, lower inference frequency, fewer control rules (9 rules), and
   correlating each junction with others. It is applicable to multiple
   junctions and multiple lanes without any modification. The experimental
   results with low, medium and high traffic loads confirm the performance
   of the proposed FTJSC. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a proposal for business simulation compiler. This compiler
   can utilize and modify a business simulation on the WWW easily for any
   person who is inexperienced in program development. This compiler was
   created as part of our business simulation course. The course we are
   developing consists of. (i) a simple gaming experiment among multiple
   students using Alexander Islands, a tiny business simulation on the WWW;
   (ii) lectures to let students understand the core concepts of systems
   management through the simulation; and (iii) the development of a
   homemade simulation model by the students themselves using business
   model description language (BMDL) and a business model development
   system (BMDS). Our course is unique in the sense that, through the
   business simulation, we aim to develop students' skills: (1) to
   implement their own specific models of business firms, (2) to develop
   information systems for the firms, and (3) to understand business
   processes among companies. This paper describes the background and
   motivation, basic principles, the architecture and implementation of
   BMDL/BMDS, and the results of the experiments. (C) 2002 Published by

Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{115-146}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the approach to relaxing consistency
   requirement of serializability to improve the performance of real-time
   database systems. We make use of the property that a read-only
   transaction (ROT) only reads, but does not update any data item. Since
   there is a significant proportion of ROTs in several real-time systems,
   it is important to investigate how to process ROTs effectively. We
   define a weaker form of consistency, view consistency, which allows ROTs
   to perceive different serialization orders of update transactions.
   Although view consistency permits non-serializablility, ROTs are still
   ensured to see consistent data. We devise a separate algorithm to
   process ROTs from update transactions for view consistency. For
   comparison, we devise another separate algorithm to process ROTs for
   strong consistency that is equivalent to serializability. Our simulation
   results show that the two separate algorithms outperform the locking and
   optimistic protocols significantly. Using separate algorithms reduces
   the interference between ROTs and update transactions. This reduced
   interference alleviates the impact of concurrency control on real-time
   priority-driven scheduling and improves the timeliness of the system. To
   our great surprise, the two separate algorithms perform almost the same.
   In our investigation, we found that most data conflicts between an ROT
   and update transactions are independent data conflicts. These
   independent data conflicts can be easily resolved by using a separate
   algorithm even under serializability.Thus, this observation indicates
   that Using a separate algorithm to process ROTs from update transactions
   is more effective than relaxing consistency requirement. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The concept of a fuzzy automaton, as studied in the literature, is a
   direct generalization of the classical concept of a non-deterministic
   automaton. In this paper, we consider the question of whether there is a
   deterministic counterpart to the notion of a fuzzy automaton. We propose
   a definition of deterministic fuzzy automata and show that they are
   equally powerful as fuzzy automata. Compared to the classical notion of
   a deterministic automaton, the deterministic fuzzy automaton defined in
   our paper differs essentially only in that the final states form a fuzzy
   set. Moreover, we show that deterministic fuzzy automata are equally
   powerful as nested systems of deterministic automata. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We compare support vector machines (SVMs) to Rocchio, Ide regular and
   Ide dec-hi algorithms in information retrieval (IR) of text documents
   using relevancy feedback. It is assumed a preliminary search finds a set
   of documents that the user marks as relevant or not and then feedback
   iterations commence. Particular attention is paid to IR searches where
   the number of relevant documents in the database is low and the
   preliminary set of documents used to start the search has few relevant
   documents. Experiments show that if inverse document frequency (IDF)
   weighting is not used because one is unwilling to pay the time penalty
   needed to obtain these features, then SVMs are better whether using
   term-frequency (TF) or binary weighting. SVM performance is marginally
   better than Ide dec-hi if TF-IDF weighting is used and there is a
   reasonable number of relevant documents found in the preliminary search.
   If the preliminary search is so poor that one has to search through many
   documents to find at least one relevant document, then SVM is preferred.

Abstract = {{We propose a new method of text classification using stochastic decision
   lists. A stochastic decision list is an ordered sequence of IF-THEN-ELSE
   rules, and our method can be viewed as a rule-based method for text
   classification having advantages of readability and refinability of
   acquired knowledge. Our method is unique in that decision lists are
   automatically constructed on the basis of the principle of minimizing
   extended stochastic complexity (ESC), and with it we are able to
   construct decision lists that have fewer errors in classification. The
   accuracy of classification achieved with our method appears better than
   or comparable to those of existing rule-based methods. We have
   empirically demonstrated that rule-based methods like ours result in
   high classification accuracy when the categories to which texts are to
   be assigned are relatively specific ones and when the texts tend to be
   short. We have also empirically verified the advantages of rule-based
   methods over non-rule-based ones. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Documents are generally represented for retrieval by either extracting
   index terms from them or by creating and selecting from an external set
   of candidate terms. There are many procedures for doing this, but while
   work continues along these dimensions, there have been relatively few
   attempts to change this basic process. Of particular importance is the
   creation of indexing schemes for retrieval systems in non-library
   contexts. Here, the cost of developing an indexing scheme independent of
   the documents to be retrieved is often considered too high to implement.
   As a result, simple full-text retrieval or, to a lesser extent,
   automatic extractive or associative indexing methods are the predominant
   methods used in non-library contexts. This paper suggests an alternative
   document representation method based on what we call exemplary
   documents. Exemplary documents are those documents that describe or
   exhibit the intellectual structure of a particular field of interest. In
   so doing, they provide both an indexing vocabulary for that area and,
   more importantly, a narrative context in which the indexing terms have a
   clearer meaning. Further, it is much easier to develop an indexing
   scheme by using exemplary documents than it is to do so from scratch.

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Each design element or layer in an information system interacts with
   every other design layer in a synergistic, neutral, or conflicting
   manner. This cascade of interactions culminates in the interface, where
   all the prior interactions have either worked to produce effective
   information retrieval or to produce a hodgepodge of system elements
   working at cross-purposes. Very large networked and World-Wide-Web-based
   online databases and online public access catalogs provide numerous
   illustrative examples of how the cascade works. Good design requires
   that these interactions be well understood and properly designed for the
   purposes of the information system in question. Interactions among
   metadata and indexing systems, information system front-ends, user
   search capabilities, and interface design are discussed and used as
   illustrations for the effective design of digital library access. (C)

Abstract = {{A growing body of studies is developing approaches to evaluating human
   interaction with Web search engines, including the usability and
   effectiveness of Web search tools. This study explores a user-centered
   approach to the evaluation of the Web search engine Inquirus - a Web
   meta-search tool developed by researchers from the NEC Research
   Institute. The goal of the study reported in this paper was to develop a
   user-centered approach to the evaluation including: (1) effectiveness:
   based on the impact of users' interactions on their information problem
   and information seeking stage, and (2) usability: including screen
   layout and system capabilities for users. Twenty-two volunteers searched
   Inquirus on their own personal information topics. Data analyzed
   included: (1) user pre- and post-search questionnaires and (2) Inquirus
   search transaction logs. Key findings include: (1) Inquirus was rated
   highly by users on various usability measures, (2) all users experienced
   some level of shift/change in their information problem, information
   seeking, and personal knowledge due to their Inquirus interaction, (3)
   different users experienced different levels of change/shift, and (4)
   the search measure precision did not correlate with other user-based
   measures. Some users experienced major changes/shifts in various
   user-based variables, such as information problem or information seeking
   stage with a search of low precision and vice versa. Implications for
   the development of user-centered approaches to the evaluation of Web and
   information retrieval (IR) systems and further research are discussed.

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an empirical study into gender
   differences in collaborative Web searching, conducted in a grade-six
   classroom of a Canadian elementary school. Searches undertaken by 16
   same-sex groups of two or three students (six of boys, ten of girls) for
   information to support a class assignment were captured on videotape.
   The multiple search sessions took place over several weeks. An analysis
   of the search sessions reveals that the groups of boys formulated
   queries comprising fewer keywords than the groups of girls, the boys
   spent less time on individual pages than the girls, the boys clicked
   more hypertext links per minute than the girls, and in general were more
   active while online. The study overall demonstrates academic, affective
   and behavior differences between grade-six boys and girls working in
   same-sex groups on a Web-based class project. (C) 20021 Elsevier Science

   taken from nuclear power plant operators while they perform the turbine
   operations. First, we apply a fuzzy system to extract the heart beat
   intervals from the ECG and a smoothing algorithm for the variation of
   the resulting heart beat intervals to obtain a trend variable. Next, we
   apply the same smoothing algorithm to the alpha-band frequencies and to
   the theta-band frequencies to get their trend curves. Finally, the three
   trend variables; the variation of the heart beat intervals, the
   alpha-band power, and the theta-band power are combined by a pair of
   fuzzy systems to estimate the mental workload during nuclear power plant
   operations. The results of applying our algorithm to three different
   data sets are included, along with a comparison between these results
   and the results obtained by applying a linear combination of the three
   variables. Compared results show that the `mental workload' computed by
   fuzzy systems with nonlinear rules reflects the changes more clearly
   than the ones computed by linear functions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In this paper, we use the interior-outer-set model to calculate the risk
   of crop flood and order farming alternatives for Huarong County, China,
   where only a small sample of eight observations is available. Any risk
   assessment from the data must be imprecise. The risk calculated by this
   suggested model is a particular case among imprecise probabilities,
   called possibility-probability distribution. We discuss in detail how to
   order alternatives based on a possibility-probability distribution. The
   result shows, aside subjective assessment, the fuzzy risk can also be
   calculated. The comparison shows that the ordering based on a calculated
   fuzzy risk is better than one based on a histogram estimate. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Risk analysis involves the development of the probability distribution
   for the measure of effectiveness. The risk associated with an investment
   alternative is generally either given as the possibility of an
   unfavorable value of the measure of effectiveness or measured by the
   variance of the measure of effectiveness. In an uncertain economic
   decision environment, an expert's knowledge about discounting cash flows
   consists of a lot of vagueness instead of randomness. Cash amounts and
   interest rates are usually estimated by using educated guesses based on
   expected values or other statistical techniques to obtain them. Fuzzy
   numbers can capture the difficulties in estimating these parameters. In
   this paper, the formulas for the analyses of fuzzy present value, fuzzy
   equivalent uniform annual value, fuzzy future value, fuzzy benefit-cost
   ratio, and fuzzy payback period are developed and given some numeric
   examples. Then the examined cash flows are expanded to geometric and
   trigonometric cash flows and using these cash flows fuzzy present value,
   fuzzy future value, and fuzzy annual value formulas are developed for
   both discrete compounding and continuous compounding. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The survivors of atomic bombings and those who visited Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki immediately after the atomic bombing could have been subjected
   to many other possible noxious effects in addition to atomic radiation.
   Various toxic substances must have been released from destroyed
   hospitals, laboratories, drugstores, storehouses of chemicals and so on.
   Among the destroyed facilities, a large storage of gasoline for the army
   transportation and containers of mustard gas for chemical weapons are
   possibly included. There was no food and the drinking water was
   contaminated. There would have been various possibilities of infection.
   It is confusing which factor played a dominant role, but, the authors
   emphasize that, in addition to ionizing radiation, various other,direct
   and indirect factors such as the noxious factors must be considered
   instead of ascribing all the effects solely to ionizing radiation.
   In addition, it is important to consider the uncertainties involved in
   the above various factors and their combined effects. Under emergency
   conditions of wartime or accidents, much fuzziness may be added to the
   randomness. The authors propose a method to analyze the total
   cause-effect relationships. The method uses a simple model to visualize
   how the total effect is intuitively derived from various factors with
   uncertainties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology has been elaborated to derive contingency factors for
   evaluating in a realistic way the costs of first-of-the-kind projects in
   radioactive waste management (RWM). The paper describes the practical
   implementation of the fuzzy decision support system (FDSS) and its
   interface to assist economists in charge of the economic calculus.
   Uncertainties to be added on top of basic cost evaluations are
   represented by two contingency factors, respectively, called the P- and
   the T-factors. The P-factor represents the uncertainties of the project
   induced by its still incomplete advancement; the T-factor represents the
   uncertainties caused by the still insufficient technological maturity on
   which the project is based. Progressive implication rules of the Goguen
   type are used with the two contingency factors as outputs. Input
   variables for P and T are given on relative {[}0,1] scales. Fuzzy logic
   is also used as front-end for obtaining the two inputs in the course of
   peer reviews of technology-experts and project-specialists. To that aim,
   the semantic opinions and past experience of the latter are expressed in
   the form of conditional and unconditional rules. The credibility of
   T-experts and P-specialists are taken into account by using the
   Kleene-Dienes inference. A numerical example on the cost of disposal of
   high-level radioactive waste in a deep repository is used to illustrate
   the practical use of the FDSS. This approach is also applicable to other
   economic assessments inside or outside the nuclear field. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new efficient technique is introduced to check the
   logical consistency of first-order function-free stratified
   knowledge-based decision-support systems (KBs). It is based on a
   progressive instantiation schema that enables us to benefit from the
   power of local search techniques for propositional satisfiability and
   search. It combines a knowledge preference pre-ordering with a concept
   of depth-limited reasoning. An algorithm that proves efficient very
   often is proposed. It delivers a good approximation of Benferhat et
   al.'s preferred maximal inclusion-based consistent sub-bases. The
   approach is extended to cover forms of non-monotonic KBs, as well. (C)

Abstract = {{Many countries concluding comprehensive safeguards agreements with the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are currently going to agree a
   new additional protocol (INFCIRC/540). The protocol will make them
   provide more information to the IAEA. The expanded framework is expected
   to establish stronger and more efficient IAEA safeguards system, which
   we call ``Integrated Safeguards{''}. however, there seems to be no
   evaluation method that enables inspectorate to derive a final evaluation
   from the information collected through the Integrated Safeguards
   Implementation. Evaluation of safeguards-effectiveness should be to
   estimate a degree of assurance to what extent the objective is attained.
   In this case, the assurance-degree of the following proposition should
   be given, ``No nuclear material in a country is used for manufacture of
   nuclear explosive devices{''}. In this paper, a simple method is
   proposed to calculate the assurance-degree of non-manufacture of nuclear
   explosive devices. The method uses a simple logic tree and fuzzy
   linguistic variables as its inputs. In addition, the method is shown to
   be useful for considering the efficient implementation of safeguards.
   For example, case-studies by the method show that conventional
   safeguards inspection efforts relevant to low enriched uranium and spent
   fuels can be reduced to half by introducing the integrated safeguards
   activities relevant to highly enriched uranium and plutonium. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Maps have been major sources of information for a long time. Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) use digital data, elevation models, satellite
   images, expert systems and related open source information for planning,
   detection, evaluation and decision making. Maps as well as GIS use
   spatial attributes of data in particular. Spatial Information derived is
   a feature of both data and language to communicate results of analysis
   and interpretation.
   A natural language approach to geographic concepts is discussed focusing
   on the cognitive aspects of categorizing spatial terms, which are
   represented by vague descriptions. Scientific analysis, however,
   requires a formal representation of spatial terms. The translation of
   linguistic concepts to spatial terms like ``steep slopes{''} involves
   inherent uncertainties that are dealt with by implementing fuzzy logic
   tools to computer-based GIS. MapModels is a programming language based
   on ArcView(R) GIS that allows users easily to comprehend geographical
   (spatial) terms by means of analytical tools including membership
   models. A flowchart interface is preferred to a line-code oriented
   programming language thus enabling the user to focus on a particular
   problem rather than a complex programming exercise. Examples are given
   on how MapModels utilizes the vagueness of geographic description in GIS
   analysis. This paper shows, how MapModels enhances the powerful options
   of GIS-based spatial analysis in obtaining information from cell-based
   images. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe in this paper a hybrid method for adaptive model-based
   control of non-linear dynamic systems using Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic
   and Fractal Theory. The new neuro-fuzzy-fractal method combines Soft
   Computing (SC) techniques with the concept of the fractal dimension for
   the domain of Non-Linear Dynamic System Control. The new method for
   adaptive model-based control has been implemented as a computer program
   to show that our neuro fuzzy-fractal approach is a good alternative for
   controlling non-linear dynamic systems. We illustrate in this paper our
   new methodology with the case of controlling aircraft dynamic systems.
   For this case, we use mathematical models for the simulation of aircraft
   dynamics during flight. The goal of constructing these models is to
   capture the dynamics of the aircraft, so as to have a way of controlling
   this dynamics to avoid dangerous behavior of the aircraft dynamic
   system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A robust adaptive fuzzy control (RAFC) scheme, which can be used to
   control a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in which the robust
   relative degree is equal to the system's degree, is proposed for the
   problem of ship roll stabilization. The uncertain system can be
   transformed into the controllability canonical form by the global
   diffeomorphism. Using the universal approximation capability of the
   fuzzy system, we construct a fuzzy system as the upper bound of
   uncertainties in the nonlinear uncertain system. Based on Lyapunov
   direct method, we prove that the RAFC scheme proposed in this paper can
   guarantee the closed-loop system to converge exponentially with a
   prescribed degree towards a residual ball around the equilibrium. Since
   only one parameter needs to be adapted on-line, the computing load of
   the proposed RAFC algorithm can be significantly reduced. We then
   demonstrate how to design a RAFC for ship roll stabilization. The
   feasibility of the proposed method is verified through a container ship
   simulation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multitarget tracking problems are theoretically interesting because,
   unlike other estimation problems, the origins of the measurements are
   not identified. This involves hypothesis generation and their evaluation
   in terms of degree of agreement between the given measurements and the
   underlying tracks. Typical algorithms to deal with such problems are the
   probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) in the case of single
   target tracking and joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF)
   in the case of multiple target tracking proposed by Bar-Shalom and his
   team. The basis of JPDAF is the calculus of the joint probabilities over
   all targets and hits. The algorithm assigns weights for reasonable hits
   and uses a weighted centroid of those hits to update the track. In this
   paper, we propose a new weight assignment based on fuzzy c-means
   methodology. Particularly, in order to take account for the false alarms
   (clutter) where none of the measurements is target originated, a new
   noisy fuzzy c-means algorithm is elaborated. The latter contrasts with
   that provided by Dave regarding the location of the noise prototype as
   well as the meaning of the universality of the noise class. The
   treatment of conflictual situations where, for instance, more than one
   hit fail in a target extension gate is accomplished using some weighted
   based procedure with respect to all feasible joint matrices involved in
   the construction of joint probabilities in JPDAF. In the meantime, the
   general methodology of PDAF and JPDAF remains unchanged. This leads to
   Hybrid Fuzzy PDAF in the case of single target tracking and Hybrid Fuzzy
   JPDAF in the case of multiple target tracking. This investigation shows
   a fruitful combination between fuzzy and probabilistic approaches in
   order to accomplish target tracking tasks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We discuss the importance of making a fuzzy controller human
   interpretable and give an overview of the existing models and structures
   for that purpose. We then summarise our approach to designing fuzzy
   controllers based on the B-spline model by learning. By using an optimal
   partition algorithm and linguistic modificators like ``between{''}, ``at
   most{''}, ``at least{''}, etc., the rule base can be reduced to the
   minimum. This helps to avoid the over-fitting problem and improves the
   interpretability of the model. We tested the controller on different
   benchmark problems and achieved a rule compression ratio of up to 71\%.

Abstract = {{The classical McCulloch and Pitts neural unit is widely used today in
   artificial neural networks (NNs) and essentially acts as a non-linear
   filter. Classical NN are only capable of approximating a mapping between
   inputs and outputs in the form of a lookup table or ``black box{''} and
   the underlying abstract relationships between inputs and outputs remain
   hidden. Motivated by the need in the study on neural and neurofuzzy
   architectures, for a more general concept than that of the neural unit,
   or node, originally introduced by McCulloch and Pitts, we developed in
   our previous work the concept of the morphogenetic neural (MN) network.
   In this paper we show that in contrast to the classical NN, the MN
   network can encode abstract, symbolic expressions that characterize the
   mapping between inputs and outputs, and thus show the internal structure
   hidden in the data. Because of the more general nature of the MN, the MN
   networks are capable of abstraction, data reduction and discovering,
   often implicit, relationships. Uncertainty can be expressed by a
   combination of evidence theory, concepts of quantum mechanics and a
   morphogenetic neural network. With the proposed morphogenetic neural
   network it is possible to perform both rigorous and approximate
   computations (i.e. including semantic uncertainty). The internal
   structure in data can be discovered by identifying ``invariants{''},
   i.e. by finding (generally implicit) dependencies between variables and
   parameters in the model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach to extract fuzzy control rules from
   perception-based information using computing with words (CW) is firstly
   presented. The approach is based on applying fuzzy numbers and their
   arithmetic operations. The fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis, which gives a
   linguistic description on the plant and the control objective, is used
   to design a stable fuzzy controller. Secondly, that the traditional
   fuzzy-control rules can be derived systematically, rather than
   heuristically, and their stability can be guaranteed is demonstrated.
   Moreover, by introducing fuzzy numbers and their arithmetic operations,
   the ``words{''} represented by fuzzy numbers could be efficiently
   manipulated for fuzzy controller design. The performance and
   applicability of the proposed method are illustrated through the
   practical implementation of fuzzy control of a pole-balancing vehicle.

Abstract = {{Incremental class learning (ICL) provides a feasible framework for the
   development of scalable learning systems. Instead of learning a complex
   problem at once, ICL focuses on learning subproblems incrementally, one
   at a time - using the results of prior learning for subsequent learning
   - and then combining the solutions in an appropriate manner. With
   respect to multi-class classification problems, the ICL approach
   presented in this paper can be summarized as follows. Initially the
   system focuses on one category. After it learns this category, it tries
   to identify a compact subset of features (nodes) in the hidden layers,
   that are crucial for the recognition of this category. The system then
   freezes these crucial nodes (features) by fixing their incoming weights.
   As a result, these features cannot be obliterated in subsequent
   learning. These frozen features are available during subsequent learning
   and can serve as parts of weight structures built to recognize other
   categories. As more categories are learned, the set of features
   gradually stabilizes and learning a new category requires less effort.
   Eventually, learning a new category may only involve combining existing
   features in an appropriate manner. The approach promotes the sharing of
   learned features among a number of categories and also alleviates the
   well-known catastrophic interference problem. We present promising
   results of applying the ICL approach to the unconstrained handwritten
   digit recognition problem, based on a spatio-temporal representation of
   patterns, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce and investigate a class of neural
   architectures of Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs), discuss a
   comprehensive design methodology and carry out a series of numeric
   experiments. PNN is a flexible neural architecture whose structure
   (topology) is developed through learning. In particular, the number of
   layers of the PNN is not fixed in advance but becomes generated on the
   fly. In this sense, PNN is a self-organizing network. The essence of the
   design procedure dwells on the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH).
   Each node of the PNN exhibits a high level of flexibility and realizes a
   polynomial type of mapping (linear, quadratic, and cubic) between input
   and output variables. The experimental part of the study involves two
   representative time series such as Box-Jenkins gas furnace data and a pH
   neutralization process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A fuzzy random variable is a measurable function from a probability
   space to a collection of fuzzy sets, while a random fuzzy variable is a
   function from a collection of random variables to {[}0, 1]. This paper
   provides a spectrum of random fuzzy dependent-chance programming in
   which the underlying philosophy is based on selecting the decision with
   maximal chance to meet the event. In order to speed up the solution
   process, we train a neural network to approximate chance functions based
   on the training data generated by the random fuzzy simulation. Finally,
   we integrate random fuzzy simulation, neural network and genetic
   algorithm to produce a more powerful and effective hybrid intelligent
   algorithm for solving random fuzzy dependent-chance programming models,
   and illustrate its effectiveness by some numerical examples. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Variation operators can be characterized by the probability mass that
   they associate with potential solutions from the state space of all
   possible solutions. Analysis is undertaken to show that the space of
   reachable probability mass functions is fundamentally hierarchical. The
   class of n-parent operators can generate a more diverse set of possible
   probabilistic searches of the state space than can be obtained by (n -
   1)-parent operators, or even a succession of (n - 1)-parent operators.
   The result suggests that greater attention might be usefully applied in
   the exploration of multiparent variation operators. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mobile computing paradigm has emerged due to advances in wireless or
   cellular networking technology. This rapidly expanding technology poses
   many challenging research problems in the area of mobile database
   systems. The mobile users can access information independent of their
   physical location through wireless connections. However, accessing and
   manipulating information without restricting users to specific locations
   complicates data processing activities. There are computing constraints
   that make mobile database processing different from the wired
   distributed database computing. In this paper, we survey the fundamental
   research challenges particular to mobile database computing, review some
   of the proposed solutions and identify some of the upcoming research
   challenges. We discuss interesting research areas, which include mobile
   location data management, transaction processing and broadcast, cache
   management and replication and query processing. We highlight new
   upcoming research directions in mobile digital library, mobile data
   warehousing, mobile workflow and mobile web and e-commerce. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In every text, some words have frequency appearance and are considered
   as keywords because they have a strong relationship with the subjects of
   their texts, these words' frequencies change with time-series variation
   in a given period. However, in traditional text dealing methods and text
   search techniques, the importance of frequency change with time-series
   variation is not considered. Therefore, traditional methods could not
   correctly determine the index of word's popularity in a given period. In
   this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate automatically the
   stability classes (increasing, relatively constant, and decreasing) that
   indicate word's popularity with time-series variation based on the
   frequency change in past text data. At first, learning data were
   produced by defining five attributes to measure the frequency change of
   a word quantitatively. These five attributes were extracted
   automatically from electronic texts. These learning data were manual
   (human) classified into three stability classes. Then, these data were
   subjected to a decision tree to determine automatically stability
   classes of analysis data (test data). For learning data, we obtained the
   attribute values of 443 proper nouns that were extracted from 2216
   articles of CNN newspapers (19971999) that discussed professional
   baseball. For testing data, 472 proper nouns that were extracted from
   972 articles of CNN newspaper (1997-2000) then classified them
   automatically using decision tree. According to the comparison between
   the evaluation of the decision tree results and manually (human)
   results, F-measures of increasing, relatively constant and decreasing
   classes were 0.847, 0.851, and 0.768, respectively, and the
   effectiveness of this method is achieved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sixty corporate websites selected from the Fortune Global 500 companies
   were examined in 2000 and again in 2001 to see if they provided support
   for automatic indexing. In particular, use of the robots.txt and Meta
   tags for ``keywords{''} and ``description{''} was examined. Slightly
   fewer than half of the sites provided one or both of these aids. Among
   sites providing indexing aids there was a clear under-representation or
   Asian sites. Nearly 80\% of the sites used Java, suggesting a reasonable
   level of technical sophistication among website creators. About
   one-third of the sites used cookies, raising the possibility that repeat
   visitors might find the navigation of the site customized to their
   needs. Overall an increase in the use of indexing aids, especially Meta
   tags., represents one way in which web robots could index sites more
   quickly and thus improve overall index coverage of the web. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{We need to access objective information efficiently and arbitrary
   strings in the text at high speed. In several key retrieval strategies,
   we often use the binary trie for supporting fast access method in order.
   Especially, the Patricia trie (Pat tree) is famous as the fastest access
   method in binary tries, because it has the shallowest tree structure.
   However, the Pat tree requires many good physician storage spaces in
   memory, if key set registered is large. Thereby, an expense problem
   happens when storing this trie to the main storage unit. We already
   proposed a method that use compact bit stream and compress a Pat tree to
   solve this problem. This is called Compact Patricia trie (CPat tree).
   This CPat tree needs capacity of only a very few memory device. However,
   if a size of key set increases, the time expense that search, update key
   increases gradually. This paper proposes a new structure of the CPat
   tree to avoid that it takes much time in search and update about much
   key set, and a method to construct a new CPat tree dynamically and
   efficiently. This method divides a CPat tree consisting of bit string to
   fixed depth. In addition, it compose been divided CPAT tree
   hierarchically. A construction algorithm that proves this update time
   requires alteration of only one tree among whole trees that is divided.
   From experimental result that use 120,000 English substantives and
   70,000 Japanese substantives, we prove an update time that is faster
   more than 40 times than the traditional method. Moreover, a space
   efficiency of memory increases about 35\% only than the traditional
   method. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the possibility and usefulness of applying
   Habermas' universal pragmatics to analyze information retrieval
   interaction. The first part of the article is theoretical argumentation.
   It examines the current common schemes of studies of human computer
   interaction (HCI), inspects their appropriateness and limitations,
   argues for a pragmatic perspective, and elaborates some of Habermas'
   idea of universal pragmatics. The second part is a case study. It
   reports an investigation of the initiation and development of
   verification of validity claims in HCI from the universal pragmatics
   perspective. It describes some patterns in which a user deals with what
   may be considered as invalid claims of an IR system outputs. A typical
   sequence consists of the following pattern: (1) user invokes a simple
   request; (2) system replies with a questionable answer: leading to (3)
   user tries to verify the validity claims of truth, truthfulness, and/or
   rightness of the system output; and (4) when the available interaction
   channels cannot support the validation, the interaction becomes a
   non-communicative process which discourages further interaction. (C)

Abstract = {{Although a substantial number of research projects have addressed music
   information retrieval over the past three decades, the field is still
   very immature. Few of these projects involve complex (polyphonic) music;
   methods for evaluation are at a very primitive stage of development;
   none of the projects tackles the problem of realistically large-scale
   databases. Many problems to be faced are due to the nature of music
   itself. Among these are issues in human perception and cognition of
   music, especially as they concern the recognizability of a musical
   phrase. This paper considers some of the most fundamental problems in
   music information retrieval, challenging the common assumption that
   searching on pitch (or pitch-contour) alone is likely to be satisfactory
   for all purposes. This assumption may indeed be true for most monophonic
   (single-voice) music, but it is certainly inadequate for polyphonic
   (multi-voice) music. Even in the monophonic case it can lead to
   misleading results. The fact, long recognized in projects involving
   monophonic music, that a recognizable passage is usually not identical
   with the search pattern means that approximate matching is almost always
   necessary, yet this too is severely complicated by the demands of
   polyphonic music. Almost all text-IR methods rely on identifying
   approximate units of meaning, that is, words. A fundamental problem in
   music IR is that locating such units is extremely difficult, perhaps
   impossible. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing focus on what is collectively known as ``knowledge
   management{''}, a shift continues to take place in commercial
   information system development: a shift away from the well-understood
   data retrieval/database model, to the more complex and challenging
   development of commercial document/information retrieval models. While
   document retrieval has had a long and rich legacy of research, its
   impact on commercial applications has been modest. At the enterprise
   level most large organizations have little understanding of, or
   commitment to, high quality document access and management. Part of the
   reason for this is that we still do not have a good framework for
   understanding the major factors which affect the performance of
   large-scale corporate document retrieval systems, The thesis of this
   discussion is that document retrieval - specifically, access to
   intellectual content - is a complex process which is most strongly
   influenced by three factors: the size of the document collection;, the
   type of search (exhaustive, existence or sample); and, the determinacy
   of document representation. Collectively, these factors can be used to
   provide a useful framework for, or taxonomy of, document retrieval. and
   highlight some of the fundamental issues facing the design and
   development of commercial document retrieval systems. This is the first
   of a series of three articles. Part II (D.C. Blair, The challenge of
   commercial document retrieval. Part II. A strategy for document
   searching based on identifiable document partitions, Information
   Processing and Management, 2001b, this issue) will discuss the
   implications of this framework for search strategy, and Part III (D.C.
   Blair, Some thoughts on the reported results of Text REtrieval
   Conference (TREC), Information Processing and Management, 2002,
   forthcoming) will consider the importance of the TREC results for our
   understanding of operating information retrieval systems. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The innovation and evolution of network technologies and services to
   enhance network functionality have traditionally encountered the
   problems of backward-compatibility and standardization. To resolve the
   related issues, active networks have been introduced to enable specific
   customization of network functionality without the lengthy
   standard-mediated committee processes. In this paper. we exploit the
   capability of mobile agent technology to construct an active network
   architecture. We argue that the mobile agent can be a building block for
   specific network customizations, and introduction of new network
   functionality. Both integrated and discrete operational models of
   network customizations can be supported in our prototype implementation.
   For the service development and deployment, an abstract service
   structure and a service loading mechanism are presented. Furthermore, we
   provide an agent management/control mechanism and devise a service
   management/control mechanism, which is either not available or
   incomplete in the other related work. The proposed architecture allows
   new service introduction, and as a result, achieves improved network
   functionality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In wide-area and heterogeneous environments, it is necessary to deploy
   media gateways at strategic locations within the networks, in order to
   deliver customized and compose-able multimedia services to individual
   users. In many cases., media gateways have to be dynamically discovered,
   because (1) a host may not know a priori all the media gateways it will
   possibly use, and (2) the change of host location or end-to-end resource
   condition can make a known media gateway no longer useful. However,
   current general service location mechanisms are not sufficient to
   perform media gateway discovery. In this paper, we present MeGaDiP, a
   wide-area Media Gateway Discovery Protocol. It is based on the same
   basic architecture of the general service location mechanisms, and can
   be seen as a discovery heuristics that will be invoked first when
   discovering a media gateway. The key properties of MeGaDiP include: (1)
   awareness of both source and destination end hosts: any discovered media
   gateway will not create an excessively long path between the end hosts
   via the gateway; (2) resource-awareness: any discovered media gateway is
   likely to have sufficient end-to-end resources to perform its service;
   (3) return of discovery results with low latency and high validity by
   caching and resource validation; (4) small amount of management traffic,
   regardless of the number of media gateways and end hosts in the
   environment. Further-more, an extension to MeGaDiP using a hierarchical
   architecture is proposed to improve the discovery success rate. The
   initial performance results from both our prototype implementation and
   simulation show the soundness of MeGaDiP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Media data are variable-bit-rate (VBR) in nature due to the coding and
   compression technologies applied. As VBR streams are complicated for
   network management, different approaches were proposed to shape the VBR
   stream as a transmission schedule with smoothed traffic burst, In this
   paper, instead of giving a fixed schedule result, a novel traffic
   shaping scheme is proposed to decide a schedulable region for all
   optimal transmission schedules that provides the minimal allocation and
   maximal utilization of system resources (such as network bandwidth,
   initial delay and client buffer). Experiments have shown that our
   obtained shaping results show dramatic improvements than that of
   conventional approaches in both the client buffer size and the network
   idle rate achieved. Based on the schedulable region provided, the ready
   time and deadline for each media packet can be precisely specified to
   support real-time network scheduling and error control. It allows users
   to determine their own optimal schedules under various
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and resource constraints. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{It is critical for applications to obtain enough quality of service

   are changed by methods. The objects are manipulated by multiple

   discuss new types of consistency of multimedia objects with respect to
   QoS. Since it takes a longer time to perform a method on multimedia
   objects, the throughput of the system is decreased if objects are
   exclusively locked in traditional concurrently control. We separate a
   concurrency control mechanism to two orthogonal ones, one for
   serializing transactions and the other for mutually exclusive access to
   objects. The timestamp ordering protocol is adopted for the former one
   and the locking protocol for the latter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Video segmentation provides an easy and efficient way for video
   retrieval and browsing. A frame is detected as a shot change frame if
   its content is very different from its previous frames. The process of
   segmenting videos into shots is usually time consuming due to the large
   number of frames in the videos. In this paper, we propose a new approach
   for segmenting videos into shots on MPEG coded video data. This approach
   detects shot changes by computing the shot change probability for each
   frame. The MPEG coded video data are only partially decoded such that
   the time for decoding and processing video data frame by frame and pixel
   by pixel can be avoided. A set of masks for different types of MPEG
   coded frames (1, P, and B frames) is defined for the computation of the
   shot change probability.
   Experiments based on various parameters are performed to show a 95\% of
   detection rate in average. With further consideration on detecting the
   dissolve effect, the result is improved to reach an average 98\% recall
   and 96\%) precision of the detection. A video indexing tool based on
   this approach was implemented. The results of detected shot changes are
   kept such that video retrieval and browsing can be provided. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Predicting the evolution of software engineering technology is, at best,
   a dubious proposition; most typically, it is a frustrating exercise in
   disappointment and anxiety. It is not difficult to see why: the
   evolution of software technology is fast paced, and is determined by a
   dizzying array of factors, many of them outside the arena of software
   engineering, and most of them cannot be identified, let alone predicted,
   with any significant advance notice. In this paper, we briefly discuss
   our first ventures in this domain, and some (very) preliminary
   conclusions and resolutions. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Naira is a compiler for Haskell, written in Glasgow parallel Haskell. It
   exhibits modest, but irregular, parallelism that is deter-mined by
   properties of the program being compiled, e.g. the complexity of the
   types and of the pattern matching. We report four experiments into
   Naira's parallel behaviour using a set of realistic inputs: namely the
   18 Haskell modules of Naira itself. The issues investigated are:
   Does increasing input size improve sequential efficiency and speedup?
   To what extent do high communications latencies reduce average
   parallelism and speedup?
   Does migrating running threads between processors improve average
   parallelism and speedup at all latencies? (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Automated prototyping tool-kit (APT) is an integrated set of software
   tools that generate source programs directly from real-time
   requirements. The APT system uses a fifth-generation prototyping
   language to model the communication structure, timing constraints, I/O
   control, and data buffering that comprise the requirements for an
   embedded software system. The language supports the specification of
   hard real-time systems with reusable components from domain specific
   component libraries. APT has been used successfully as a research tool
   in prototyping large war-fighter control systems (e.g. the
   command-and-control station, cruise missile flight control system,
   patriot missile defense systems) and demonstrated its capability to
   support the development of large complex embedded software. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithm for automatic outline capture of
   digital character images, particularly suitable for non-Roman languages
   like Arabic. In most of the desktop publishing systems, the shapes of
   the characters are stored in the computer memory in terms of their
   outlines, and the outlines are expressed as cubic Bezier curves. The
   process of producing outlines includes various steps, detection of
   boundary, discovering corner points and break points and fitting the
   curve. This process becomes slow and inaccurate if there is any
   involvement of humans in any of the above steps. The work done, in this
   paper, fully automates the process and produces the best optimal
   results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In {[}M.M. Gammoudi et al., in: Proceedings Lecture Notes of the
   International Conference on Conceptual Modeling ER'97, Los Angeles,
   November 1997; M.M. Gammoudi et al., in: The 18th International
   Conference on Conceptual Modelling (ER'99), Paris, November 15-18,
   Lecture Notes, Springer, Berlin, 1999] we proposed a semi-automatic
   method for generating inheritance graph hierarchy for the purpose of
   assisting the designer during the definition of his conceptual schema.
   The motivation for this work was the very few approaches which attempt
   to provide methods and tools for designing inheritance graph in object
   databases {[}R. Wille, in: E. Diday (Ed.), Data Analysis, Learning
   Symbolic and Numeric Knowledge, Nova Science, New York, 1989], and
   object software {[}A.L. Winblad et al., Object-Oriented Software,
   Addison-Wesley, New York, 1990]. To address some limitations found in
   our work, we propose a new method whose principles are: (i) From a
   binary relation which represents the links between entities and their
   properties and methods, our proposed heuristic generates and organizes
   incrementally a set of optimal rectangles into a brut inheritance graph
   (BIG). (ii) BIG is refined and submitted to the designer. (iii) The
   designer can modify, add or remove classes, attributes or methods in the
   binary relation and activate step (i) until he obtains a proper class
   hierarchy or an optimal inheritance graph. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an automatic approach designed to improve the
   retrieval effectiveness of very short queries such as those used in web
   searching. The method is based on the observation that stemming, which
   is designed to maximize recall, often results in depressed precision.
   Our approach is based on pseudo-feedback and attempts to increase the
   number of relevant documents in the pseudo-relevant set by re-ranking
   those documents based on the presence of unstemmed query terms in the
   document text. The original experiments underlying this work were
   carried out using Smart 11.0 and the Inc.ltc weighting scheme on three
   sets of documents from the TREC collection with corresponding TREC
   (title only) topics as queries. (The average length of these queries
   after stoplisting ranges from 2.4 to 4.5 terms.) Results, evaluated in
   terms of P@20 and non-interpolated average precision, showed clearly
   that pseudo-feedback (PF) based on this approach was effective in
   increasing the number of relevant documents in the top ranks. Subsequent
   experiments, performed on the same data sets using Smart 13.0 and the
   improved Lnu. ltu weighting scheme, indicate that these results hold up
   even over the much higher baseline provided by the new weights. Query
   drift analysis presents a more detailed picture of the improvements
   produced by this process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{When accessing an information retrieval system, it has long been said
   that undergraduates who are in an exploratory stage of researching their
   essay topic should use a high recall search strategy; what prevents them
   from doing so is the information overload factor associated with showing
   the undergraduate a long list of citations. One method of overcoming
   information overload is summarizing and visualizing the citation list.
   This paper examines five summarization and visualization schemes for
   presenting information retrieval (IR) citation output, then discusses
   whether these schemes are appropriate for undergraduates and other
   domain novice users. We ask and answer four questions: (1) What is the
   message these schemes try to communicate and (2) is this message
   appropriate for domain novice users like undergraduates? (3) How do
   these schemes communicate their message and (4) is how they communicate
   the message appropriate for a domain novice? We conclude that (i) the
   most appropriate message for information space visualizations for domain
   novice users is associative thinking, and (ii) the message should be
   communicated with a standardized look that remains relatively constant
   over time so that the shape and form of the visualization can become
   familiar and thus useful to students as they navigate their way through
   the information space produced by a high recall search strategy. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to design information retrieval (IR) systems to support various
   information-seeking strategies across a variety of contexts, it is
   important to explore what leads to the selection of different types of
   information-seeking strategies. This study addresses the issue by
   investigating the relationships between users' information-seeking goals
   and their information-seeking behaviors. The particular focus of this
   study is to specify hierarchical levels of user goals, and to
   investigate the micro-level goal labeled ``interactive intention{''} in
   relation to information-seeking strategies. A total of 40 users from
   four types of libraries were selected for this study, and the analysis
   illustrates how changes in interactive intentions are associated with
   changes of information-seeking strategies. The results present how eight
   types of interactive intentions, four types of entities, eight types of
   methods, and six types of resources constitute the patterns of
   interactive intentions and information-seeking strategies. The
   implications for IR system design are further discussed. (C) 2001

Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{91-109}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In Korean text, foreign words, which are mostly transliterations of
   English words, are frequently used. Foreign words are usually very
   important index terms in Korean information retrieval since most of them
   are technical terms or names. So accurate foreign word extraction is
   crucial for high performance of information retrieval. However, accurate
   foreign word extraction is not easy because it inevitably accompanies
   word segmentation and most of the foreign words are unknown. In this
   paper, we present an effective foreign word recognition and extraction
   method. In order to accurately extract foreign words, we developed an
   effective method of word segmentation that involves unknown foreign
   words. Our word segmentation method effectively utilizes both unknown
   word information acquired through the automatic dictionary compilation
   and foreign word recognition information. Our HMM-based foreign word
   recognition method does not require large labeled examples for the model
   training unlike the previously proposed method. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This research is a part of ongoing study to better understand citation
   analysis on the Web. It builds on Kleinberg's research (J. Kleinberg, R.
   Kumar, P. Raghavan, P. Rajagopalan, A. Tomkins, Invited survey at the
   International Conference on Combinatorics and Computing, 1999) that
   hyperlinks between web pages constitute a web graph structure and tries
   to classify different web graphs in the new coordinate space:
   out-degree, in-degree. The out-degree coordinate is defined as the
   number of outgoing web pages from a given web page. The in-degree
   coordinate is the number of web pages that point to a given web page. In
   this new coordinate space a metric is built to classify how close or far
   are different web graphs. Kleinberg's web algorithm (J. Kleinberg,
   Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 1998, pp.
   668-677) on discovering ``hub web pages{''} and ``authorities web
   pages{''} is applied in this new coordinate space. Some very uncommon
   phenomenon has been discovered and new interesting results interpreted.
   This study does not look at enhancing web retrieval by adding context
   information. It only considers web hyperlinks as a source to analyze
   citations on the web. The author believes that understanding the
   underlying web page as a graph will help design better web algorithms,
   enhance retrieval and web performance, and recommends using graphs as a
   part of visual aid for search engine designers. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the measurement of bias in search engines on the
   World Wide Web. Bias is taken to mean the balance and representativeness
   of items in a collection retrieved from a database for a set of queries.
   This calls for assessing the degree to which the distribution of items
   in a collection deviates from the ideal. Ascertaining this ideal poses
   problems similar to those associated with determining relevance in the
   measurement of recall and precision. Instead of enlisting subject
   experts or users to determine such an ideal, a family of comparable
   search engines is used to approximate it for a set of queries. The
   distribution is obtained by computing the frequencies of occurrence of
   the uniform resource locators (URLs) in the collection retrieved by
   several search engines for the given queries. Bias is assessed by
   measuring the deviation from the ideal of the distribution produced by a
   particular search engine. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study caching strategies for proxies that cache VBR-encoded
   continuous media objects for highly interactive streaming applications.
   First, we develop a model for streaming VBR-encoded continuous media
   objects. This model forms the basis for a stream admission control
   criterion and our study of caching strategies. We find that unlike
   conventional web caches, proxy caches for continuous media objects need
   to replicate or stripe objects to achieve high hit rates. We develop
   novel caching strategies that either implicitly or explicitly track the
   request pattern and cache (and replicate) objects accordingly. Our
   numerical results indicate that our caching strategies achieve
   significantly higher hit rates than caching without object replication.

Abstract = {{We propose a novel object-oriented design approach for developing a
   platform-neutral IP/TV presentation system for playing live TV-like MPEG
   video streams on the Internet multicast by RTP-compliant servers. Unlike
   proprietary viewers, such as Cisco's IP/TV viewers, which run only on
   Windows platforms, our system runs on any Java Virtual Machine
   environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design approach
   via actual experimentations. We also propose a Java-based relay agent
   architecture for relaying RTP streams across multicast-enabled routers.
   We show that our system is particularly suitable to run as relay agents
   in this architecture to tackle the cross-platform issue and to
   accommodate various audio or video media sources efficiently. By
   adhering to the Internet and multimedia standards, our system is
   generically applicable to various media streaming systems. (C) 2002

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the Agent-based Imagery and Geospatial processing
   Architecture (AIGA). AIGA is a novel approach for developing and
   supporting large-scale query-driven multimedia information systems. AIGA
   is designed to support collaboration and reuse by defining a set of
   light-weight agents and a combined knowledge encoding and agent
   communication language called I-XML. Scalability and reuse are achieved
   by employing a two-tier communication structure, Agents do not
   communicate directly but rather through a shared page space. We show how
   this approach simplifies system design and facilitates collaboration and
   information sharing among area experts.
   AIGA is specifically designed to allow experts to answer open-ended
   queries such as ``What is the current situation at the border between
   two countries?{''}. For this environment the reuse of prior strategies
   reduces the number of computations necessary to construct new answers.
   We have implemented AIGA in a Java environment. We believe the resulting
   system demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in constructing
   large-scale query-driven multimedia information systems. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Tangible Interfaces for Collaborative Learning Environments (TICLE)
   explores new ways that multimedia can enhance education without becoming
   the focus of the educational experience. A TICLE system ``watches{''} as
   children work together on puzzles and other educational tasks in a
   physical environment. The system then responds as a 11 guide on the
   side{''}, providing the sort of encouragement and prodding that a
   teacher would. This builds on children's innate love of puzzles, their
   collaborative tendencies, and their inclination to learn by doing.
   Although such a system cannot replace a qualified teacher, it can help
   teachers to motivate and reach more students simultaneously.
   This paper outlines the strategies used to create a TICLE system, and
   describes one implementation: a multimedia multimodal system that
   responds to children playing with a Tangram. puzzle. This system has

Abstract = {{In spite of the great success of many distance learning programs, how to
   evaluate the behavior of student performance in an off-line distance
   learning course still remains a question. If visiting Web course content
   is a basic requirement of performance assessment, it is possible to make
   an automatic tool to help the instructor and the students in terms of
   Web interaction analysis. This paper proposes a solution to the
   automation. A newly proposed mechanism, called Student-Problem.-Course
   (SPC) table is discussed. The mechanism is implemented on a
   Windows-based platform. Instructors and students both benefit from the
   system of using the performance evaluation to redesign course material
   and to review automatically generated tutorials. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multimedia technology is increasingly being used to create instructional
   environments for distance education. However, the design of educational
   multimedia is currently driven more by intuition than by empirically or
   theoretically derived design guidelines. In the absence of prescriptive
   design principles, iterative design - a cyclical process of design, test
   and redesign - becomes critically important for creating effective
   educational multimedia. This paper proposes a framework for the
   iterative design of a class of educational multimedia called Hypermedia
   Educational Manuals. The architecture of an authoring and evaluation
   platform designed to support this framework and ease the designer's task
   is presented. Two unique features of this tool are the automatic
   creation of a system structure definition of the multimedia system being
   authored, and the automatic incorporation of interact ion-logging
   elements in the system. This is done by an authoring component that
   assists the designer with the design and implementation of educational
   multimedia. An evaluation component then parses both the system
   structure definition and interaction logs created while students work
   with the multimedia system, in order to generate statistical analyses
   and graphical visualizations of how students interacted with the
   multimedia. The integrated architecture of the tool embodies a tight
   coupling between the design of educational multimedia and the evaluation
   of its effectiveness. This coupling reduces the time and effort required
   in repeating evaluation-redesign cycles in order to iteratively refine
   the initial design. We also briefly describe an experimental
   demonstration of the utility of this tool. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Virtual reality-based training systems (VRTSs) are advanced
   computer-assisted training systems using Virtual Reality (VR)
   technology. To have better structure and easier implementation, a
   virtual training system can be modeled as an integrated system

   simulation module, a performance evaluation module, and an interface
   module. Presented in this paper are an architecture of VR-based training
   systems and a practical knowledge modeling approach to modeling the
   training scenarios of the systems by using Petri nets formalism. A
   Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling operations virtual training
   prototype system was developed to illustrate the feasibility and
